TI - Th1 / Th2 type cytokines in hepatitis B patients treated with <prot>  interferon - alpha </prot>  .
AB - OBJECTIVE : To investigate the relationship between the expression of Th1 / Th2 type cytokines and the effect of <prot>  interferon - alpha </prot>  therapy .
METHODS : Th1 / Th2 type cytokines were assayed by enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) on 23 patients with chronic hepatitis B who were treated with <prot>  interferon - alpha </prot>  .
RESULTS : Levels of <prot>  IFN - gamma </prot>  in the supernatant of peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) cultures from the patients with hepatitis B were slightly lower than those of controls ( P = 0.07 ) .
However , the levels of <prot>  IL - 4 </prot>  were higher than those of controls ( P = 0.01 ) .
Cytokines measurements during <prot>  IFN - alpha </prot>  treatment showed a trend to decreasing levels of <prot>  IL - 4 </prot>  at 4 , 12 , and 24 weeks .
Levels of <prot>  IFN - gamma </prot>  were slightly increased following <prot>  IFN - alpha </prot>  treatment ( P = 0.09 ) .
In patients with a complete response to <prot>  IFN - alpha </prot>  , the levels of <prot>  IFN - gamma </prot>  were higher at 24 weeks following <prot>  IFN - alpha </prot>  treatment than that of pre - treatment ( P = 0.04 ) , and the levels of <prot>  IL - 4 </prot>  decreased markedly at 12 and 24 weeks ( P = 0.02 , 0.03 , respectively ) . mRNA expression positively correlated with the level of Th1 / Th2 type cytokines in the supernatant .
CONCLUSION : The expression of Th2 type cytokines is predominant in patients with chronic hepatitis B .
 <prot> Interferon - alpha </prot>  therapy can modulate the balance of Th1 / Th2 type cytokines , and this is related to its clinical effect .
Levels of Th1 / Th2 type cytokines could be a predictor of clinical response during <prot>  Interferon - alpha </prot>  treatment .

TI - The molar ratio of serum <prot>  retinol - binding protein </prot>  ( <prot>  RBP </prot>  ) to <prot>  transthyretin </prot>  ( <prot>  TTR </prot>  ) is not useful to assess vitamin A status during infection in hospitalised children .
AB - OBJECTIVE : To assess the usefulness of the molar ratio of serum <prot>  retinol - binding protein </prot>  ( <prot>  RBP </prot>  ) to <prot>  transthyretin </prot>  ( <prot>  TTR </prot>  ) to determine vitamin A ( VA ) status during infection .
DESIGN : We took advantage of previously collected data during a randomised double - blind , placebo - controlled clinical trial to conduct a secondary analysis of the <prot>  RBP </prot>  / <prot>  TTR </prot>  ratio and its relationship to infection and VA status .
In this clinical trial , children were randomly assigned to one of three groups and received either one single oral high dose of VA ( 200 000 IU ) on the day of admission and subsequently a placebo daily until discharge or daily oral low doses of VA ( 5000 IU ) from admission until discharge or a placebo daily from admission until discharge .
SETTING : Lwiro pediatric hospital , Province of South Kivu , Democratic Republic of Congo .
SUBJECTS : A total of 900 children aged 0 - 72 months hospitalised consecutively between March 1994 and March 1996 .
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : <prot>  RBP </prot>  / <prot>  TTR </prot>  molar ratio after 7 days hospitalisation .
RESULTS : After 7 days hospitalisation , molar <prot>  RBP </prot>  : <prot>  TTR </prot>  ratio ( mean+ / - s.d. ) of infected children ( C - reactive proteins GTTTTT 10 mg / l ) was 0.67+ / - 0.31 in the high - dose group ( n = 81 ) , 0.74+ / - 0.44 in the low dose group ( n = 71 ) and 0.73+ / - 0.39 in the placebo group ( n = 81 ) . These values did not differ significantly ( one - way ANOVA P = 0.472 ) . In patients with baseline serum retinol concentrations LTTTTT 0.70 micromol / l , changes in <prot>  RBP </prot>  : <prot>  TTR </prot>  ratio between admission and day 7 were not statistically different in the three groups ( one - way ANOVA P = 0.548 ) . CONCLUSIONS : In this population of malnourished hospitalised children , molar <prot>  RBP </prot>  : <prot>  TTR </prot>  ratio does not appear to be useful to assess VA status during infection.

TI - Role of cyclin - dependent kinase inhibitors in the growth arrest at senescence in human prostate epithelial and uroepithelial cells .
AB - Cellular senescence has been proposed to be an in vitro and in vivo block that cells must overcome in order to immortalize and become tumorigenic .
To characterize these pathways , we focused on changes in the cyclin - dependent kinase inhibitors and their binding partners that underlie the cell cycle arrest at senescence .
As a model , we utilized normal human prostate epithelial cell ( HPEC ) and human uroepithelial cell ( HUC ) cultures .
After 30 - 40 population doublings cells became growth - arrested in G0 / 1 with a threefold decrease in <prot>  Cdk2 </prot>  - associated activity , a point defined as pre - senescence .
Temporally following this growth arrest , the cells develop a senescence morphology and express <prot>  senescence - associated <prot>  beta - galactosidase </prot>  </prot>  ( <prot>  SA - beta - gal </prot>  ) .
Levels of <prot>  p16 </prot>  ( <prot>  INK4a </prot>  ) and <prot>  p57 </prot>  ( <prot>  KIP2 </prot>  ) rise in HUCs during progressive passages , whereas only <prot>  p16 </prot>  increases in HPEC cultures .
The induced expression of <prot>  p57 </prot>  , similar to <prot>  p16 </prot>  , produces a senescent - like phenotype .
 <prot> pRB </prot>  , <prot>  cyclin D </prot>  , <prot>  p19 </prot>  ( <prot>  INK4d </prot>  ) and <prot>  p27 </prot>  ( <prot>  KIP1 </prot>  ) decrease in both cell types .
We find that <prot>  p53 </prot>  , <prot>  p21 </prot>  ( <prot>  CIP1 </prot>  ) and <prot>  p15 </prot>  ( <prot>  INK4b </prot>  ) are transiently elevated in HPECs and HUCs at the pre - senescent growth arrest , then return to low proliferating levels at terminal senescence .
Analysis of <prot>  p53 </prot>  , <prot>  p21 </prot>  ( <prot>  CIP1 </prot>  ) , <prot>  p15 </prot>  ( <prot>  INK4b </prot>  ) , <prot>  p16 </prot>  ( <prot>  INK4a </prot>  ) , and <prot>  p57 </prot>  ( <prot>  KIP2 </prot>  ) reveals altered expression in immortalized , non - tumorigenic HPV16 E6 and E7 prostate lines and in tumorigenic prostate cancer cells .
These results indicate : ( i ) the existence of a subset of growth inhibiting genes elevated at the onset of the senescence , ( ii ) a distinct class of genes involved in the maintenance of senescence , and ( iii ) the frequent inactivation of these pathways during immortalization .

TI - Positive inotropic responses mediated by endothelin <prot>  ET ( A ) </prot>  and <prot>  ET ( B ) </prot>  receptors in human myocardial trabeculae .
AB - The aim of the present study was to determine possible inotropic effects mediated by endothelin <prot>  ET ( A ) </prot>  and <prot>  ET ( B ) </prot>  receptors in human myocardial trabeculae from the right atrium and the left ventricle .
Isolated trabeculae from human hearts were paced at 1.0 Hz in tissue baths , and changes in isometric contractile force upon exposure to agonist were studied .
 <prot> Endothelin - 1 </prot>  ( <prot>  ET - 1 </prot>  ) and <prot>  ET - 3 </prot>  had a strong positive inotropic effect in all trabeculae .
 <prot> ET - 1 </prot>  was significantly more potent than <prot>  ET - 3 </prot>  in both atrial ( P LTTTTT 0.001 ) and ventricular ( P LTTTTT 0.05 ) trabeculae .
Preincubation with the <prot>  ET ( A ) receptor </prot>  antagonist FR139317 ( 1 microM ) decreased significantly ( P LTTTTT 0.005 ) the potency of <prot>  ET - I </prot>  in both atrial and ventricular trabeculae , without any significant changes in Emax ( maximum effect obtained with an agonist ) .
The <prot>  ET ( B ) receptor </prot>  agonist IRL 1620 had a positive inotropic effect only in some trabeculae , and the <prot>  ET ( B ) receptor </prot>  antagonist BQ 788 ( 1 microM ) almost completely blocked this effect .
These results suggest that both <prot>  ET ( A ) </prot>  and <prot>  ET ( B ) </prot>  receptors mediate positive inotropic responses at both the atrial and ventricular level in the human heart .

The <prot>  bcl - 2 </prot>  and inhibitor of apoptosis protein families .
AB - The balance between pro - and antiapoptotic proteins can determine cellular fate .
In this regard , the <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  and IAP protein families have evolved as highly conserved regulators of cell death .
A further testament to their critical roles in maintaining balance between cell life and death may be the increasing implication of <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  and TAP proteins in the pathologies of human diseases .
Although much has been learned about these families of proteins , future studies of the <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  and IAP families are sure to hold more exciting discoveries and will continue to reveal new strategies for combating human diseases .

TI - A comparative study of <prot>  E - cadherin </prot>  and <prot>  stromelysin - 3 </prot>  expression in de novo and ex adenoma carcinoma of the colorectum .
AB - An apparent exception to the colorectal adenoma - carcinoma carcinogenetic pathway is the so - called AMPPPP quot ; de novo AMPPPP quot ; carcinoma which has no evidence of adenoma in its vicinity .
Despite the fact that they are often quite small , these lesions appear to be more aggressive ( i.e. , greater likelihood of lymph - node metastases ) than carcinomas that clearly arise from surrounding adenomas exadenoma carcinoma .
The purpose of the present comparative immunohistochemical study was to compare rates of cell adhesion molecule ( <prot>  E - cadherin </prot>  ) and protease [ <prot>  stromelysin - 3 </prot>  ( <prot>  ST - 3 </prot>  ) ] expression in groups of de novo ( n = 64 ) and ex adenoma ( n = 42 ) lesions in order to see whether their more aggressive behavior is associated with decreased cell adhesion and increased protease expression .
The rates of extensive <prot>  ST - 3 </prot>  expression and decreased <prot>  E - cadherin </prot>  expression were significantly higher in the de novo group ( P = 0.014 and 0.005 , respectively ) .
Histopathologically , the de novo group also had a significantly higher percentage of cases with an infiltrative invasion pattern .
These differences highlight the more aggressive phenotype of the de novo colorectal carcinoma and fit with their greater invasive potential .

Analysis of <prot>  K - ras </prot>  , <prot>  p53 </prot>  , <prot>  p16 </prot>  and <prot>  DPC4 </prot>  / <prot>  Smad4 </prot>  .
AB - The <prot>  K - ras </prot>  , <prot>  p53 </prot>  , <prot>  p16 </prot>  and <prot>  DPC4 </prot>  genes are among those most frequently altered in pancreatic ductal carcinoma .
We analyzed 22 cell lines for alterations in these genes by direct sequence analysis and methylation - specific polymerase chain reaction .
These cell lines showed mutations in <prot>  K - ras </prot>  and <prot>  p53 </prot>  at frequencies of 91 % and 95 % , respectively .
Alterations in <prot>  p16INK4a </prot>  were found in all cases and included nine homozygous deletions , seven mutations and promoter methylation in six cases .
Eight cell lines ( 36 % ) had an alteration of <prot>  DPC4 </prot>  , including one mutation and seven homozygous deletions .
The most typical mutational profile involved <prot>  K - ras </prot>  , <prot>  p53 </prot>  , and <prot>  p16INK4a </prot>  , concurrently aberrated in 20 cases ( 91 % ) .
Eight cell lines had alterations in all four genes .
Inactivation of <prot>  DPC4 </prot>  was always accompanied by alteration of all of the other three genes .
This comprehensive data regarding the cumulative genetic alterations in pancreatic carcinoma cell lines will be of great value for studies involving drug sensitivity or resistance that may be associated with inactivation of a particular gene or molecular pathway .

TI - Human gastrinoma cells express <prot>  calcium - sensing receptor </prot>  .
AB - The intravenous calcium injection test has been reported to be useful for the diagnosis of gastrinoma .
However , the mechanism underlying calcium - evoked <prot>  gastrin </prot>  release is not fully understood .
We investigated the mechanism of calcium - stimulated <prot>  gastrin </prot>  release from gastrinoma cells in vitro with a particular focus on the <prot>  calcium - sensing receptor </prot>  ( <prot>  CaR </prot>  ) .
Human gastrinoma cells were taken from mechanically minced gastrinoma tissues obtained at surgery .
In the perifusion system , high [ Ca2+ ] o induced <prot>  gastrin </prot>  release from gastrinoma cells .
As [ Ca2+ ] o increased , [ Ca2+ ] i rapidly increased , as monitored by fluorometry .
The response was not inhibited by nifedipine , a blocker of the voltage - dependent calcium channel .
Reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction and subsequent Southern blot hybridization revealed the presence of the <prot>  CaR </prot>  gene in human gastrinoma tissues .
Moreover , the expression of <prot>  CaR </prot>  in gastrinoma tissues was confirmed by immunohistochemistry .
Our results demonstrated that <prot>  CaR </prot>  was expressed in human gastrinoma cells and could be involved in the mechanism of calcium - evoked <prot>  gastrin </prot>  release .

AB - The heterotopically induced ossicles are used in our research on bone tissue .
The ossicles are formed in the thigh muscle of BALB / c mice under the influence of injected suspension of 3 x 10 ( 6 ) HeLa cells .
We postulate that the mechanism of bone induction is based on the secretion of bone morphogenetic proteins <prot>  BMP - 4 </prot>  and <prot>  BMP - 6 </prot>  by the grafted HeLa cells .
This was proved by the use of specific immunohistochemical reaction and Western blots of conditioned culture medium .
It seems that HeLa cells secrete BMPs continuously into the culture medium , even without contact with the mice muscle tissue , were induction of bone tissue is observed .

TI - Immunohistochemical analysis of epidermal growth factor receptor family members in stage I non - small cell lung cancer .
AB - BACKGROUND : To elucidate the relationship between the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor family members ( <prot>  ErbB - 1 </prot>  , neu / <prot>  ErbB - 2 </prot>  , <prot>  ErbB - 3 </prot>  , and <prot>  ErbB - 4 </prot>  ) and tumor recurrence .
METHODS : We used immunohistochemistry to examine the expression of four epidermal growth factor receptor family members in 73 patients with stage I non - small cell lung cancer .
RESULTS : Using Cox univariate analysis , we determined that angiolymphatic tumor emboli and non - well - differentiated tumor cells were two significant conventional pathologic predictors of tumor recurrence , and that <prot>  ErbB - 1 </prot>  and <prot>  ErbB - 3 </prot>  were also significant predictors .
Co - expression of <prot>  ErbB - 1 </prot>  + , - 3+ , or expression of three or more epidermal growth factor receptor family members had a significant effect on lung cancer recurrence .
A stepwise multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis provided a predictive model for tumor recurrence .
CONCLUSIONS : The present study shows that in patients with a non - well - differentiated tumor , overexpression of <prot>  ErbB - 3 </prot>  is a useful marker for predicting tumor recurrence .
The present study also confirmed that <prot>  ErbB - 1 </prot>  expression increased in proportion to the loss of tumor differentiation .
The correlation between <prot>  ErbB - 3 </prot>  and distant metastasis was good .

AB - BACKGROUND : Toxic epidermal necrolysis ( TEN ) is a rare but severe adverse drug disease , characterized by extensive skin and mucosal detachment with participation of different immunoinflammatory pathways , in particular with early participation of activated <prot>  CD8 </prot>  + T lymphocytes .
OBJECTIVE : To further study the potential role of T lymphocytes in the early phase of keratinocyte necrosis .
DESIGN : Prospective study .
SETTING : University hospitals .
PATIENTS : Thirteen patients with clinical and histopathologic criteria of TEN and 6 patients with second - degree burns .
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : Measurement of soluble <prot>  interleukin ( IL ) 2 receptor </prot>  ( <prot>  sIL - 2R </prot>  ) and <prot>  IL - 1alpha </prot>  in serum samples and fluid of recent blisters .
RESULTS : In the blister fluid of patients with TEN , we found significantly higher levels of <prot>  sIL - 2R </prot>  than in patients with burns , whereas <prot>  IL - 1alpha </prot>  levels were higher in the blister fluid of burned patients .
No significant differences were found in serum samples of patients with TEN and burns , in either <prot>  sIL - 2R </prot>  or <prot>  IL - 1alpha </prot>  .
In TEN we also found significantly higher levels of <prot>  sIL - 2R </prot>  in the blister fluid compared with serum samples , pointing to a predominantly local production contrasting with the low concentration of <prot>  sIL - 2R </prot>  in the blister fluid of burned patients .
CONCLUSIONS : Our findings of elevated <prot>  sIL - 2R </prot>  levels in blister fluid of patients with TEN are probably related to a local down - regulation of an immunologically mediated cytotoxic reaction and further support the involvement of activated T lymphocytes in the early blisters of TEN .

TI - Potential cellular signatures of viral infections in human hematopoietic cells .
AB - Expression profiling of cellular genes was performed using a 10 , 000 cDNA human gene array in order to identify expression changes following chronic infection of human hematopoietic cells with Kaposi 's Sarcoma - associated Virus ( KSHV ) also known as Human Herpesvirus 8 ( HHV8 ) and Human T cell leukemia virus - 1 ( HTLV - 1 ) .
We performed cell - free in vitro infection of primary bone marrow derived <prot>  CD34 </prot>  + cells using semi - purified HHV8 and a mature <prot>  IL - 2 </prot>  dependent T cell line , KIT 225 , using highly concentrated viral stocks prepared from an infectious molecular clone of HTLV - 1 .
Thirty days post infection , mRNA was isolated from infected cultures and uninfected controls and submitted for microarray analysis .
More than 400 genes were differentially expressed more than two - fold following HHV8 infection of primary bone marrow derived <prot>  CD34 </prot>  + cells .
Of these 400 , <prot>  interferon regulatory factor 4 </prot>  ( <prot>  IRF4 </prot>  ) , <prot>  cyclin B2 </prot>  , TBP - associated factor , eukaryotic elongation factor and <prot>  pim 2 </prot>  were up - regulated more than 3.5 fold .
In contrast , less than 100 genes were differentially expressed more than two - fold following chronic infection of a mature T cell line with HTLV - 1 .
Of these , only <prot>  cdc7 </prot>  was up - regulated more than 3.5 fold .
These data may provide insight into cellular signatures of infection useful for diagnosis of infection as well as potential targets for therapeutic intervention .

AB - Concentrations of <prot>  glial fibrillary acidic protein </prot>  ( <prot>  GFAp </prot>  ) and <prot>  light subunit neurofilament protein </prot>  ( <prot>  NFL </prot>  ) in cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) were measured in patients with second - stage Trypanosoma brucei gambiense sleeping sickness .
Correlations between <prot>  GFAp </prot>  and <prot>  NFL </prot>  in CSF as markers for astrogliosis and neurodegeneration , and clinical and biological data were investigated .
Abnormal levels of <prot>  GFAp </prot>  and <prot>  NFL </prot>  were significantly associated with increasing CSF cell number and protein concentration , and with the absence of lymph nodes or the absence of trypanosomes in lymph node aspirate .
A significant association was found between abnormal <prot>  NFL </prot>  and presence of trypanosomes in CSF , abnormal limb movements , difficulties in gait and coordination , and low Karnofsky index .
By multivariate analysis , it was shown that increasing CSF cell number , increasing CSF protein concentration , and the absence of lymph nodes or the absence of trypanosomes in the lymph node aspirate were the best predictors for astrogliosis and neurodegeneration among the variables tested .
These results demonstrate the importance of CSF cell count and protein determination in assessment of the severity of central nervous system involvement and reinforces the importance of laboratory diagnosis to assess the stage of the disease .
The clinical symptoms studied were less useful in predicting astrogliosis or neurodegeneration .

TI - <prot>  Interleukin - 10 </prot>  levels in seminal plasma : implications for chronic prostatitis - chronic pelvic pain syndrome .
AB - PURPOSE : Chronic prostatitis - chronic pelvic pain syndrome is a disease of unknown pathogenesis .
We investigated whether the chronic inflammation and pain experienced by patients may be caused by an imbalance of proinflammatory versus anti - inflammatory cytokines within the prostate , namely <prot>  interleukin ( IL ) - 8 </prot>  , <prot>  interferon - gamma </prot>  and <prot>  IL - 2 </prot>  versus <prot>  IL - 10 </prot>  .
We measured these inflammatory cytokines in seminal plasma as a reflection of the prostate environment .
MATERIALS AND METHODS : We measured levels of <prot>  IL - 8 </prot>  , <prot>  interferon - gamma </prot>  , <prot>  IL - 2 </prot>  and <prot>  IL - 10 </prot>  in the seminal plasma of 31 patients with chronic prostatitis - chronic pelvic pain syndrome and 14 controls using enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay .
Results were correlated with health related quality of life , as measured by the Multidimensional Pain Inventory , McGill pain questionnaire and International Prostate Symptom Score .
RESULTS : The cytokines analyzed were detectable in the seminal plasma of patients with chronic prostatitis - chronic pelvic pain syndrome and controls .
 <prot> Interferon - gamma </prot>  , <prot>  IL - 2 </prot>  and <prot>  IL - 10 </prot>  levels were statistically greater in patients .
Furthermore , <prot>  IL - 10 </prot>  levels correlated directly with measures of life interference ( r = 0.52 , p LTTTTT 0.01 ) and pain severity ( r = 0.53 , p LTTTTT 0 0.01 ) , and inversely with spousal support ( r = - 0.39 , p LTTTTT 0.04 ) .
CONCLUSIONS : Our study suggests that <prot>  IL - 10 </prot>  may have a role in the pain symptoms experienced by patients with chronic prostatitis - chronic pelvic pain syndrome .

TI - Adeno - associated virus vector - mediated triple gene transfer of dopamine synthetic enzymes .
AB - OBJECTIVE : To explore triple gene transfer of dopamine synthetic enzymes with separate adeno - associated virus ( AAV ) vectors .
METHODS : The genes for dopamine synthetic enzymes , <prot>  tyrosine hydroxylase </prot>  ( <prot>  TH </prot>  ) , <prot>  aromatic L - amino acid decarboxylase </prot>  ( <prot>  AADC </prot>  ) , and <prot>  GTP cyclohydrolase I </prot>  ( <prot>  GCH </prot>  , an enzyme critical for tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis ) were contransduced into 293 cells with separate AAV vectors .
Expressions of <prot>  TH </prot>  , <prot>  AADC </prot>  and <prot>  GCH </prot>  were detected by Western blot analysis .
Intracellular dopamine level was assayed by high - performance liquid chromatography .
RESULTS : <prot>  TH </prot>  , <prot>  AADC </prot>  and <prot>  GCH </prot>  were effectively coexpressed in transduced cells with three separate AAV vectors , AAV - <prot>  TH </prot>  , AAV - <prot>  AADC </prot>  and AAV - <prot>  GCH </prot>  .
Furthermore , the coexpression resulted in an effectively spontaneous dopamine production in cotransduced cells .
CONCLUSION : The triple transduction of <prot>  TH </prot>  , <prot>  AADC </prot>  and <prot>  GCH </prot>  genes with separate AAV vectors is effective , which might be important to gene therapy for Parkinson 's disease .

TI - Genetic studies on the role of proteinases and growth factors in atherosclerosis and aneurysm formation .
AB - Expression analysis and epidemiologic studies have provided indirect evidence that proteinases and growth factors play a role in the development of atherosclerosis and complications such as aneurysm formation and plaque rupture .
Studies using genetically altered mice have proven to be an elegant tool to study the causal involvement of these factors in atherogenesis and to gain insight into the underlying mechanisms .
Recently , proteinases of the plasminogen and matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) systems as well as their inhibitors have received much attention , and these studies together have emphasized the complexity of their role in vascular disease .
This overview summarizes the current knowledge on <prot>  plasminogen activator inhibitor - 1 </prot>  ( <prot>  PAI - 1 </prot>  ) in the progression of atherosclerosis and the influence of MMPs in aneurysm formation .
In addition , a possible role for <prot>  Gas6 </prot>  , the product of <prot>  growth arrest - specific gene 6 </prot>  , in atherosclerotic lesion development is put into perspective .

TI - Chromatin image analysis provides new evidence of the relation of lymphocytes to cytokines and <prot>  sCAM </prot>  in the inflammatory nature of atherosclerosis .
AB - Comparative analysis of cytokines and <prot>  sCAM </prot>  secretion within the lymphocyte chromatin state are possible evidence of inflammatory reactions in atherosclerosis .
Two types of response were studied : coagulation and fibrinolysis ( incubation of blood clot within 6 hours at 37 degrees C ) and standardized viscosimetric flow using a rotational viscometer ( shear rate 100 l / s , 60 seconds at 37 degrees C , and incubation within 6 hours at 37 degrees C ) .
Cytokines <prot>  IL - 1alpha </prot>  , <prot>  IL - 1beta </prot>  , <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  , <prot>  IL - 8 </prot>  , <prot>  IL - 10 </prot>  ( Immunotech , France ) , <prot>  endothelin - 1 </prot>  , and <prot>  soluble cell adhesion molecules </prot>  ( <prot>  sCAM </prot>  ) sP - and <prot>  sE - selectin </prot>  , <prot>  sICAM - 1 </prot>  , and <prot>  sVCAM - 1 </prot>  ( R AMPPPP D , UK ) have been determined using ELISA kits ( photometer , Biomek - 1000 , Beckman , USA ) .
The chromatin of lymphocyte nuclei was studied using the computer TV morphodensitometry system DiaMorph ( Russia ) and smears dyed specifically for DNA .
Correlational changes in morphodensitometric ( MDM ) parameters and cytokine and <prot>  sCAM </prot>  levels in two tests were compared to initial levels .
After rheologic testing , lymphocyte nuclei as a whole had not changed , but chromatin activity had decreased .
Reorganization of nuclei after the coagulation test was observed .
 <prot> Endothelin - 1 </prot>  and sP - and <prot>  sE - selectin </prot>  levels were not related to function of lymphocytes ( by MDM data ) as seen in both tests ; it is probable that another cell - cell communication mechanism had been switched on .
We established a strong correlation between chromatin activity of lymphocytes and the serum concentration of <prot>  IL - 1beta </prot>  , <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  , and <prot>  IL - 10 </prot>  , which are the active participants in the pro - and anti - inflammatory program in atherogenesis .
Results are evidence of the role of lymphocytes in pro - and anti - inflammatory cytokine reactions and cytokine - like <prot>  sCAM </prot>  activity in atherosclerosis .

Resistance to infection is affected by the ability of macrophages to phagocytose and destroy the bacilli .
Several genes are involved in this process , and two have been the focus of recent interest : the <prot>  natural resistance - associated protein </prot>  ( <prot>  NRAMP1 </prot>  ) gene and the genes coding for the <prot>  vitamin D receptor </prot>  .
Susceptibility genes have also been discovered -- for example , one on the X chromosome that may explain the increased susceptibility of males to tuberculosis .
Studies have also focused on the variations in virulence of the bacillus in both its drug - susceptible and drug - resistant forms .
These mechanisms must be understood in order to prevent , or combat , the emergence of a virulent , multidrug - resistant form of the bacillus that would be uncontrollable by means of today 's treatment strategies .

TI - Inflammatory gene polymorphisms and ischaemic heart disease : review of population association studies .
AB - Inflammation and genetics are both prominent mechanisms in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and arterial thrombosis .
Accordingly , a number of population studies have explored the association of ischaemic heart disease with gene polymorphisms of the inflammatory molecules <prot>  tumour necrosis factors ( TNF ) alpha </prot>  and beta , <prot>  transforming growth factors ( TGF ) beta1 </prot>  and 2 , <prot>  interleukin ( IL ) 1 </prot>  and its receptor antagonist ( <prot>  IL 1ra </prot>  ) , <prot>  CD14 </prot>  ( the receptor for lipopolysaccharide ) , P and E selectins , and <prot>  platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule ( PECAM ) 1 </prot>  .
Although they are very preliminary and partly conflicting , the data provide some evidence that alterations in the genetics of the inflammatory system may modify the risk of ischaemic heart disease .

TI - Regulated trafficking of neurotransmitter transporters : common notes but different melodies .
AB - The activity of biogenic amine and amino acid neurotransmitters is limited by presynaptic and astrocytic Na ( + ) - dependent transport systems .
Their functional importance is underscored by the observation that these transporters are the targets of broad classes of psychotherapeutic agents , including antidepressants and stimulants .
Early studies suggested that the activity of these transporters can be fine tuned by a number of different signaling pathways .
In the past five years , several groups have provided compelling evidence that changing the cell surface availability of these transporters contributes to this fine tuning .
This regulated trafficking can result in rapid ( within minutes ) increases or decreases in the plasma membrane expression of these transporters and is independent of transcriptional or translational control mechanisms .
Many of the same signaling molecules , including <prot>  protein kinase C </prot>  ( <prot>  PKC </prot>  ) , <prot>  tyrosine kinase , phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase </prot>  ( <prot>  P13 - K </prot>  ) , and protein phosphatase , regulate the transporters for different neurotransmitters .
In addition to these classical receptor activated pathways , transporter substrates also regulate activity and cell surface expression of these transporters .
In fact , some of the transporters form complexes with signaling molecules .
Given the functional and genetic similarities of these transporters , it is not surprising that the same signaling molecules regulate their trafficking , but except for the molecules , the actual effects on individual transporters are remarkably different .
It is as if the same musical notes have been rearranged into several different melodies .

TI - Present data concerning the <prot>  renin </prot>  - <prot>  angiotensin </prot>  system of extrarenal origin .
AB - After a brief historical incursion regarding <prot>  RAS </prot>  of renal origin , we present the main extrarenal <prot>  angiotensin </prot>  - forming enzymes , starting with <prot>  isorenin </prot>  , <prot>  tonin </prot>  , D and <prot>  G cathepsin </prot>  and ending with the conversion enzyme and <prot>  chymase </prot>  .
This is followed by a short presentation of data concerning tissue <prot>  RAS </prot>  in the heart and vessels , brain and neurocranial accessory glands , cortico - suprarenal and gonadal glandular territory .
In the end we refer to the relations between circulating <prot>  RAS </prot>  of renal origin and the extrarenal <prot>  RAS </prot>  specific to tissue underlying the fact that the two <prot>  RAS </prot>  components cooperate and constitute a unitary hormonal system , regulating the major functions of the organism and maintaining the main homeostatic equilibria .
While the circulating <prot>  RAS </prot>  of renal origin is acutely activated to contribute to the accomplishment of short term homeostatic reactions , tissue <prot>  RAS </prot>  , in paracrine or autocrine ways , exerts local - regional adaptive actions of long duration .

TI - Expression of glucocorticoid receptors and <prot>  cyclooxygenase - 2 </prot>  in nasal polyps from nonallergic patients .
AB - Glucocorticoid treatment has been widely used to suppress inflammatory and immune responses .
However , from a clinical point of view , its efficacy in the treatment of nasal polyposis seems to vary individually from patient to patient .
In the present study , we examined the presence of glucocorticoid receptors ( GRs ) and <prot>  cyclooxygenase - 2 </prot>  ( <prot>  COX - 2 </prot>  ) in the nasal polyps of nonallergic patients as compared with normal controls .
Reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction analyses revealed the presence of both GR messenger RNA and <prot>  COX - 2 </prot>  messenger RNA expression in nasal polyps from nonallergic patients , as well as in normal nasal mucosa from controls .
Consistent with this finding , immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that GRs and <prot>  COX - 2 </prot>  were labeled in both tissues .
In nasal polyps , GR labeling was associated with the cytoplasm and nucleus of surface mucosa , submucosal glands , endothelial cells , and inflammatory cells .
Importantly , <prot>  COX - 2 </prot>  labeling was seen in the cytoplasm of surface mucosa , submucosal glands , and the vascular wall in nasal polyps .
In contrast , in normal nasal tissues , <prot>  COX - 2 </prot>  labeling was only found in the vascular wall , and the expression was weaker -- a finding demonstrating that <prot>  COX - 2 </prot>  is upregulated in nasal polyps .
Therefore , 1 ) the presence of GRs and <prot>  COX - 2 </prot>  in nasal polyps from nonallergic patients , as well as upregulation of <prot>  COX - 2 </prot>  expression , suggests that inflammation may play an important role in the pathophysiology of nasal polyps ; and 2 ) glucocorticoid could be a potential treatment method for suppressing inflammatory processes.

TI - Instability of extracellular matrix gene expression in primary cell culture of fibroblasts from human vocal fold lamina propria and tracheal AB - Primary fibroblast cell cultures were established from lamina propria of human vocal fold and tracheal scar .
There exists a crucial need to provide new tools for studying voice biology , and one of the first steps is the development of a human primary laryngeal cell culture bank .
Because cell lines can lose their differentiated phenotype in culture across passages , documentation of gene expression must be determined for passage populations , for us to have knowledge of cell behavior in vitro .
Comparison of messenger RNA gene expression of extracellular matrix proteins ( <prot>  procollagen I </prot>  , <prot>  collagenase </prot>  , <prot>  elastin </prot>  , <prot>  hyaluronic acid synthase 2 </prot>  , <prot>  hyaluronidase </prot>  , <prot>  fibronectin </prot>  , <prot>  cd44 </prot>  , <prot>  fibromodulin </prot>  , and <prot>  decorin </prot>  ) across cell passages ( 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 10 , and 12 fornormal laminapropria and 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , and 10 for tracheal scar ) revealed varied growth patterns .
Cytogenetic analysis demonstrated relative stability of the karyotypes across passages for the tracheal scar cell cultures , whereas the karyotypes of the normal lamina propria fibroblasts showed instability in in vitro cultures .
Recommendations for use of primary cell cultures for further studies of gene expression are made .

TI - Assaying of <prot>  tumor necrosis factor alpha </prot>  , complement factors , and <prot>  alpha - 1 - antitrypsin </prot>  in the diagnosis of malignant serous effusions .
AB - The objective of this study was to measure the concentrations of <prot>  tumor necrosis factor - alpha </prot>  ( <prot>  TNFalpha </prot>  ) in pleural and peritoneal effusions of different causes and to verify whether <prot>  TNFalpha </prot>  , <prot>  alpha - 1 - antitrypsin </prot>  ( <prot>  alpha1AT </prot>  ) , and complement factors <prot>  C3 </prot>  and <prot>  C4 </prot>  can be used in the differential diagnosis of serous effusion .
One hundred forty - five serous effusions of various origins were analyzed .
 <prot> TNFalpha </prot>  , <prot>  alpha1AT </prot>  , and complement factors <prot>  C3 </prot>  and <prot>  C4 </prot>  concentrations were measured simultaneously in blood and serous effusion using commercially available methods .
Serous effusions were classified as follows : 102 exudates and 43 transudates .
All variables were found to have good diagnostic value in the differential diagnosis of serous effusion .
In the stepwise discriminant analysis , four variables were selected , producing a significant discriminant function ( p LTTTTT 0.001 ) .
Their order of selection was <prot>  alpha1AT </prot>  effusion , <prot>  C4 </prot>  serum , <prot>  TNFalpha </prot>  - effusion , and <prot>  C3 </prot>  effusion .
Combined use of these variables increased remarkably the diagnostic value ( in diagnosing exudates versus transudates ) giving sensitivity = 93.14 % ; specificity = 90.70 % ; positive predictive value = 95.96 % ; negative predictive value = 84.78 % .
Determination of <prot>  TNFalpha </prot>  , complement factors <prot>  C3 </prot>  and <prot>  C4 </prot>  , and <prot>  alpha1AT </prot>  may be a significant parameter in the differential diagnosis of serous effusions , particularly in those patients with malignant disease .
Moreover , the combination of them significantly increased their diagnostic power .

TI - Differential expression of <prot>  granulysin </prot>  and <prot>  perforin </prot>  by NK cells in cancer patients and correlation of impaired <prot>  granulysin </prot>  expression with^M progression of cancer.^M AB - <prot>  Granulysin </prot>  has been identified as an effector molecule co - localized with <prot>  perforin </prot>  in the cytotoxic granules of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer ( NK ) cells , and has been reported to kill intracellular pathogens in infected cells in the presence of <prot>  perforin </prot>  and to induce a cytotoxic effect against tumor cells .
The aim of the present study was to elucidate whether intracellular expression of <prot>  granulysin </prot>  and <prot>  perforin </prot>  by NK cells might be associated with progression of cancer .
Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated high levels of <prot>  perforin </prot>  and <prot>  granulysin </prot>  expression by <prot>  CD3 </prot>  ( - ) <prot>  CD16 </prot>  ( + ) cells in healthy controls .
In contrast , cancer patients exhibited significantly decreased levels of <prot>  granulysin </prot>  expression ( P LTTTTT 0.005 ) , despite having equally high levels of <prot>  perforin </prot>  expression in comparison with healthy controls .
The tumor - free patients expressed <prot>  granulysin </prot>  at levels similar to healthy controls , while the progressive tumor - bearing patients expressed remarkably lower levels of <prot>  granulysin </prot>  compared to healthy controls ( P LTTTTT 0.0001 ) .
Similarly , patients with an advanced performance status had significantly fewer <prot>  granulysin </prot>  - positive NK cells than healthy controls .
Meanwhile , a considerable number of the tumor - bearing patients showed a decrease in the number of circulating NK cells , and a correlation between impaired <prot>  granulysin </prot>  expression and reduced circulating NK cells was observed .
These findings suggest that the tumor - bearing patients with impaired <prot>  granulysin </prot>  expression were in an immunosuppressive state .
In conclusion , impaired expression of <prot>  granulysin </prot>  by NK cells correlates with progression of cancer , and determination of <prot>  granulysin </prot>  expression might prove informative for assessing the immunological condition of cancer patients .

TI - Regulation of cell proliferation , apoptosis , and carcinogenesis by activin AB - The aim of this review is to provide insight into the molecular mechanisms by which <prot>  activin A </prot>  modulates cell proliferation , apoptosis , and carcinogenesis in vitro and in vivo .
 <prot> Activin A </prot>  , a member of the <prot>  TGFbeta </prot>  superfamily , has various effects on diverse biological systems , including cell growth inhibition in many cell types .
However , the mechanism ( s ) by which activin exerts its inhibitory effects are not yet understood .
This review highlights activin 's effects on activin receptors and signaling pathway , modulation of activin signaling , and regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis by activin .
Based on the experiences of all the authors , we emphasized cell cycle inhibitors such as <prot>  p16 </prot>  and <prot>  p21 </prot>  and regulators of apoptosis such as <prot>  p53 </prot>  and members of the <prot>  bcl - 2 </prot>  family .
Aside from activin 's inhibition of cell proliferation and enhancement of apoptosis , other newly developed methods for molecular studies of apoptosis by activin were briefly presented that support the role of activin as an inhibitor of carcinogenesis and cancer progression .
These methods include subtractive hybridization based on covalent bonding , a simple and accurate means to determine molecular profile of as few as 20 cells based on an RNA - PCR approach , and a messenger RNA - antisense DNA interference phenomenon ( D - RNAi ) , resulting in a long - term gene knockout effects .

TI - Identification of a new member of the tumor necrosis factor family and its receptor , a human ortholog of mouse GITR .
PG - 215 - 8 AB - The tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) and TNF receptor ( TNFR ) gene superfamilies regulate diverse biological functions , including cell proliferation , differentiation , and survival [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] .
We have identified a new TNF - related ligand , designated human <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  <p1  pair=1 >  GITR </p1>  ligand </prot>  </p1>  ( <p1  pair=3 >  <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  hGITRL </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  ) , and its human receptor ( <p2  pair=2 >  <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  hGITR </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  ) , an ortholog of the recently discovered murine <prot>  glucocorticoid - induced TNFR - related ( <prot>  mGITR </prot>  ) protein </prot>  [ 4 ] .
The <prot>  hGITRL </prot>  gene mapped to chromosome 1q23 , near the gene for the TNF homolog <prot>  Fas </prot>  / <prot>  CD95 ligand </prot>  [ 5 ] .
The <prot>  hGITR </prot>  gene mapped to chromosome 1p36 , near a cluster of five genes encoding TNFR homologs [ 1 ] [ 6 ] .
We found <prot>  hGITRL </prot>  mRNA in several peripheral tissues , and detected <prot>  hGITRL </prot>  protein on cultured vascular endothelial cells .
The levels of <prot>  hGITR </prot>  mRNA in tissues were generally low ; in peripheral blood T cells , however , antigen - receptor stimulation led to a substantial induction of <prot>  hGITR </prot>  transcripts .
Cotransfection of <prot>  hGITRL </prot>  and <prot>  hGITR </prot>  in embryonic kidney 293 cells activated the anti - apoptotic transcription factor <prot>  NF - kappaB </prot>  , via a pathway that appeared to involve <prot>  TNFR - associated factor 2 </prot>  ( <prot>  TRAF2 </prot>  ) [ 7 ] and <prot>  <prot>  NF - kappaB </prot>  - inducing kinase </prot>  ( <prot>  NIK </prot>  ) [ 8 ] .
Cotransfection of <prot>  hGITRL </prot>  and <prot>  hGITR </prot>  in Jurkat T leukemia cells inhibited antigen - receptor - induced cell death .
Thus , <prot>  hGITRL </prot>  and <prot>  hGITR </prot>  may modulate T lymphocyte survival in peripheral tissues .

TI - Differential mechanisms of recognition and activation of <prot>  interleukin - 8 </prot>  receptor subtypes .
PG - 11768 - 72 AB - We have probed an epitope sequence ( His18 - Pro19 - Lys20 - Phe21 ) in <prot>  interleukin - 8 </prot>  ( <prot>  IL - 8 </prot>  ) by site - directed mutagenesis .
This work shows that single and double Ala substitutions of His18 and Phe21 in <prot>  IL - 8 </prot>  reduced up to 77 - fold the binding affinity to <prot>  <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  IL - 8 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  receptor subtypes A </prot>  ( <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  CXCR1 </prot>  </p2>  ) and B ( <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  CXCR2 </prot>  </p2>  ) and to the <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  Duffy antigen </prot>  </p2>  .
These Ala mutants triggered neutrophil degranulation and induced calcium responses mediated by <prot>  CXCR1 </prot>  and <prot>  CXCR2 </prot>  .
Single Asp or Ser substitutions , H18D , F21D , F21S , and double substitutions , H18A / F21D , H18A / F21S , and H18D / F21D , reduced up to 431 - fold the binding affinity to <prot>  CXCR1 </prot>  , <prot>  CXCR2 </prot>  , and the <prot>  Duffy antigen </prot>  .
Interestingly , double mutants with charged residue substitutions failed to trigger degranulation or to induce wild - type calcium responses mediated by <prot>  CXCR1 </prot>  .
Except for the H18A and F21A mutants , all other <prot>  IL - 8 </prot>  mutants failed to induce superoxide production in neutrophils .
This study demonstrates that <p1  pair=4 >  <p1  pair=5 >  <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  IL - 8 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  recognizes and activates <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  CXCR1 </prot>  </p2>  , <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  CXCR2 </prot>  </p2>  , and the <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  Duffy antigen </prot>  </p2>  by distinct mechanisms .

PG - 563 - 8 AB - We screened proteins for interaction with <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  presenilin ( PS ) 1 </prot>  </p1>  , and cloned the full - length cDNA of human <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  delta - catenin </prot>  </p2>  , which encoded 1225 amino acids .
Yeast two - hybrid assay , GST binding assay and immunoprecipitation demonstrated that <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  delta - catenin </prot>  </p1>  interacted with a hydrophilic loop region in the endoproteolytic C - terminal fragment of <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  PS1 </prot>  </p2>  , but not with that of <prot>  PS - 2 </prot>  .
These results suggest that <prot>  PS1 </prot>  and <prot>  PS2 </prot>  partly differ in function .

PG - 13733 - 6 AB - <prot>  TR6 </prot>  ( <prot>  decoy receptor 3 </prot>  ( <prot>  DcR3 </prot>  ) ) is a new member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor ( TNFR ) family .
 <prot> TR6 </prot>  mRNA is expressed in lung tissues and colon adenocarcinoma , SW480 .
In addition , the expression of <prot>  TR6 </prot>  mRNA was shown in the endothelial cell line and induced by phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate / ionomycin in Jurkat T leukemia cells .
The open reading frame of <prot>  TR6 </prot>  encodes 300 amino acids with a 29 - residue signal sequence but no transmembrane region .
Using histidine - tagged recombinant <prot>  TR6 </prot>  , we screened soluble forms of TNF - ligand proteins with immunoprecipitation .
Here , we demonstrate that <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  TR6 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  specifically binds two cellular ligands , <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  LIGHT </prot>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  herpes virus entry mediator ( <prot>  HVEM </prot>  ) - L </prot>  </p2>  ) and <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  Fas ligand </prot>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  FasL </prot>  </p2>  / <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  CD95L </prot>  </p2>  ) .
These bindings were confirmed with HEK 293 EBNA cells transfected with <prot>  LIGHT </prot>  cDNA by flow cytometry .
 <prot> TR6 </prot>  inhibited <prot>  LIGHT </prot>  - induced cytotoxicity in HT29 cells .
It has been shown that <prot>  LIGHT </prot>  triggers apoptosis of various tumor cells including HT29 cells that express both <prot>  <p1  pair=9 >  <prot>  lymphotoxin beta </prot>  </p1>  receptor </prot>  ( <p2  pair=9 >  <prot>  LTbetaR </prot>  </p2>  ) and <prot>  HVEM </prot>  / <prot>  TR2 </prot>  receptors .
Our data suggest that <prot>  TR6 </prot>  inhibits the interactions of <p1  pair=6 >  <p1  pair=7 >  <p1  pair=8 >  <prot>  LIGHT </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  with <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  HVEM </prot>  </p2>  / <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  TR2 </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  LTbetaR </prot>  </p2>  , thereby suppressing <prot>  LIGHT </prot>  - mediated HT29 cell death .
Thus , <prot>  TR6 </prot>  may play a regulatory role for suppressing in <prot>  FasL </prot>  - and <prot>  LIGHT </prot>  - mediated cell death .

PG - 14163 - 9 AB - We have shown previously that Phe93 in the extracellular domain of the <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  <p1  pair=14 >  <prot>  erythropoietin </prot>  </p1>  ( <p1  pair=11 >  <prot>  EPO </prot>  </p1>  ) receptor </prot>  </p1>  ( <p1  pair=4 >  <p2  pair=14 >  <p2  pair=11 >  <prot>  EPOR </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  </p1>  ) is crucial for binding <p2  pair=3 >  <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  EPO </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  Substitution of Phe93 with alanine resulted in a dramatic decrease in <p1  pair=10 >  <p1  pair=5 >  <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  EPO </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  binding to the Escherichia coli - expressed extracellular domain of the <p2  pair=10 >  <prot>  EPOR </prot>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  <prot>  EPO </prot>  - binding protein </prot>  </p2>  or <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  EBP </prot>  </p2>  ) and no detectable binding to full - length mutant receptor expressed in COS cells .
Remarkably , Phe93 forms extensive contacts with a peptide ligand in the crystal structure of the <p1  pair=15 >  <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  EBP </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  bound to an <prot>  <prot>  EPO </prot>  - mimetic peptide </prot>  ( <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  EMP1 </prot>  </p2>  ) , suggesting that Phe93 is also important for <p2  pair=15 >  <prot>  EMP1 </prot>  </p2>  binding .
We used alanine substitution of <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=8 >  <p1  pair=9 >  <prot>  EBP </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  residues that contact <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  EMP1 </prot>  </p2>  in the crystal structure to investigate the function of these residues in both <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  EMP1 </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=9 >  <prot>  EPO </prot>  </p2>  binding .
The three largest hydrophobic contacts at Phe93 , Met150 , and Phe205 and a hydrogen bonding interaction at Thr151 were examined .
Our results indicate that Phe93 and Phe205 are important for both <prot>  EPO </prot>  and <prot>  EMP1 </prot>  binding , Met150 is not important for <prot>  EPO </prot>  binding but is critical for <prot>  EMP1 </prot>  binding , and Thr151 is not important for binding either ligand .
Thus , Phe93 and Phe205 are important binding determinants for both <p1  pair=12 >  <prot>  EPO </prot>  </p1>  and <p1  pair=13 >  <prot>  EMP1 </prot>  </p1>  , even though these ligands share no sequence or structural homology , suggesting that these residues may represent a minimum epitope on the <p2  pair=12 >  <p2  pair=13 >  <prot>  EPOR </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  for productive ligand binding .

TI - Association of terminal complement proteins in solution and modulation by suramin .
PG - 6807 - 16 AB - The association of terminal complement proteins was investigated by analytical ultracentrifugation and multi - angle laser light scattering .
Native <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  C8 </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  C9 </prot>  </p2>  formed a heterodimer in solution of physiological ionic strength with a free - energy change DeltaG degrees of - 8.3 kcal / mol and a dissociation constant Kd of 0.6 AMPPPP mgr ; M ( at 20 degrees C ) that was ionic strength - and temperature - dependent .
A va n't Hoff plot of the change in Kd was linear between 10 and 37 degrees C and yielded values of DeltaH degrees = - 12.9 kcal / mol and DeltaS degrees = - 15.9 cal mol - 1 deg - 1 , suggesting that electrostatic forces play a prominent role in the interaction of <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  C8 </prot>  </p1>  with <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  C9 </prot>  </p2>  .
Native <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  C8 </prot>  </p1>  also formed a heterodimer with <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  C5 </prot>  </p2>  and low concentrations of polyionic ligands such as protamine and suramin inhibited the interaction .
Suramin induced high - affinity trimerization of <p1  pair=4 >  <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  C8 </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  ( Kd = 0.10 microM at 20 degrees C ) and dimerization of <p1  pair=5 >  <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  C9 </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  ( Kd = 0.86 microM at 20 degrees C ) .
Suramin - induced <p1  pair=6 >  <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  C8 </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  oligomerization may be the primary reason for the drug 's ability to prevent complement - mediated hemolysis .
Analysis of sedimentation equilibria and also of the fluorescence enhancement of suramin when bound to protein provided evidence for two suramin - binding sites on each <p1  pair=7 >  <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  C9 </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  and three on each <p1  pair=8 >  <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  C8 </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  in the oligomers .
Oligomerization could be reversed by high suramin concentrations , but 8 - aminonaphthalene - 1 , 3 , 6 - trisulfonate ( ANTS2 - ) , which mimics half a suramin molecule , could not compete with suramin binding and oligomerization suggesting that the drug also binds nonionically to the proteins .

These proteins include from seven to nine putative transmembrane domains , with the N - and C - terminal ends and a large hydrophilic loop orientated towards the cytoplasm .
We report an interaction between the human <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  PS1 </prot>  </p1>  or <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  PS2 </prot>  </p1>  hydrophilic loop and <p2  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  Rab11 </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  , a small GTPase belonging to the Ras - related superfamily .
Interaction domains were mapped to codons 374 - 400 for <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  PS1 </prot>  </p1>  and to codons 106 - 179 for <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  Rab11 </prot>  </p2>  , a region including the fourth GTP - binding domain .
Considering the implication of Rab proteins in vesicular transport pathways , the PS - <prot>  Rab11 </prot>  interaction suggests that PSs might be involved in amyloid precursor protein vesicular routing .

TI - Endogenous <prot>  presenilin 1 </prot>  redistributes to the surface of lamellipodia upon adhesion of Jurkat cells to a collagen matrix .
PG - 7932 - 7 AB - Most familial early - onset Alzheimer 's disease cases are caused by mutations in the <prot>  presenilin 1 </prot>  ( <prot>  PS1 </prot>  ) gene .
Subcellular localization of the endogenous <prot>  PS1 </prot>  is essential for understanding its function , interactions with proteins , and role in Alzheimer 's disease .
Although numerous studies revealed predominant localization of <prot>  PS1 </prot>  to endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi , there are conflicting reports on the localization of <prot>  PS1 </prot>  to the cell surface .
We found that endogenous <prot>  PS1 </prot>  is highly expressed in T lymphocytes ( Jurkat cells ) .
Using a variety of methods , we present evidence that endogenous <prot>  PS1 </prot>  is localized to the cell surface in addition to intracellular membrane compartments .
Moreover , <prot>  PS1 </prot>  appeared in high levels on the surface of lamellipodia upon adhesion of the cells to a collagen matrix .
The redistribution of <prot>  PS1 </prot>  in adhered cells was strikingly similar to that of the well characterized adhesion protein CD44 .
Cell surface <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  PS1 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  formed complexes in vivo with actin - binding protein <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  filamin </prot>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  ABP - 280 </prot>  </p2>  ) , which is known to form bridges between cell surface receptors and cytoskeleton and mediate cell adhesion and cell motility .
Taken together , our results suggest a role of <prot>  PS1 </prot>  in cell adhesion and / or cell - matrix interaction .

TI - Molecular determinants of the interaction between the C - terminal domain of Alzheimer 's <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  beta - amyloid peptide </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  apolipoprotein E </prot>  </p2>  alpha - helices .
PG - 758 - 69 AB - In a previous work , we predicted and demonstrated that the 29 - 42 - residue fragment of <prot>  beta - amyloid peptide </prot>  ( <prot>  Abeta peptide </prot>  ) has in vitro capacities close to those of the tilted fragment of viral fusion proteins .
We further demonstrated that <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  apolipoprotein E2 </prot>  </p1>  and E3 but not <prot>  apolipoprotein E4 </prot>  can decrease the fusogenic activity of <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  Abeta </prot>  </p2>  ( 29 - 42 ) via a direct interaction .
Therefore , we suggested that this fragment is implicated in the neurotoxicity of <prot>  Abeta </prot>  and in the protective effects of <prot>  apolipoprotein E </prot>  in Alzheimer 's disease .
Because structurally related apolipoproteins do not interact with the <prot>  Abeta </prot>  C - terminal domain but inhibit viral fusion , we suggested that interactions existing between fusogenic peptides and apolipoproteins are selective and responsible for the inhibition of fusion .
In this study , we simulated interactions of all amphipathic helices of <prot>  apolipoproteins E </prot>  and A - I with <prot>  Abeta </prot>  and simian immunodeficiency virus ( SIV ) fusogenic fragments by molecular modeling .
We further calculated cross - interactions that do not inhibit fusion in vitro .
The results suggest that interactions of hydrophobic residues are the major event to inhibit the fusogenic capacities of <prot>  Abeta </prot>  ( 29 - 42 ) and SIV peptides .
Selectivity of those interactions is due to the steric complementarity between bulky hydrophobic residues in the fusogenic fragments and hydrophobic residues in the apolipoprotein C - terminal amphipathic helices .

TI - <prot>  CCR5 </prot>  binds multiple CC - chemokines : <prot>  MCP - 3 </prot>  acts as a natural antagonist .
PG - 1899 - 905 AB - <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  CCR5 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  was first characterized as a receptor for <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  MIP - 1alpha </prot>  </p2>  , <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  MIP - 1beta </prot>  </p2>  , and <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  RANTES </prot>  </p2>  , and was rapidly shown to be the main coreceptor for M - tropic human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) - 1 strains and simian immunodeficiency virus ( SIV ) .
Chemokines constitute a rapidly growing family of proteins and receptor - chemokine interactions are known to be promiscuous and redundant .
We have therefore tested whether other CC - chemokines could bind to and activate <prot>  CCR5 </prot>  .
All CC - chemokines currently available were tested for their ability to compete with [ ( 125 ) I ] - <prot>  MIP - 1beta </prot>  binding on a stable cell line expressing recombinant <prot>  CCR5 </prot>  , and / or to induce a functional response in these cells .
We found that in addition to <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  MIP - 1beta </prot>  </p1>  , <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  MIP - 1alpha </prot>  </p1>  , and <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  RANTES </prot>  </p1>  , five other CC - chemokines could compete for [ ( 125 ) I ] - <p2  pair=10 >  <p2  pair=11 >  <p2  pair=4 >  <p2  pair=5 >  <p2  pair=6 >  <p2  pair=7 >  <p2  pair=8 >  <p2  pair=9 >  <prot>  MIP - 1beta </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  </p2>  </p2>  </p2>  </p2>  </p2>  </p2>  binding : <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  MCP - 2 </prot>  </p1>  , <p1  pair=8 >  <prot>  MCP - 3 </prot>  </p1>  , <p1  pair=9 >  <prot>  MCP - 4 </prot>  </p1>  , <p1  pair=10 >  <prot>  MCP - 1 </prot>  </p1>  , and <p1  pair=11 >  <prot>  eotaxin </prot>  </p1>  binding was characterized by IC ( 50 ) values of 0.22 , 2.14 , 5.89 , 29.9 , and 21.7 nmol / L , respectively .
Among these ligands , <p1  pair=12 >  <prot>  MCP - 3 </prot>  </p1>  had the remarkable property of binding <p2  pair=12 >  <prot>  CCR5 </prot>  </p2>  with high affinity without eliciting a functional response , <p1  pair=14 >  <prot>  MCP - 3 </prot>  </p1>  could also inhibit the activation of <p1  pair=13 >  <prot>  CCR5 </prot>  </p1>  by <p2  pair=13 >  <prot>  MIP - 1beta </prot>  </p2>  and may therefore be considered as a natural antagonist for <p2  pair=14 >  <prot>  CCR5 </prot>  </p2>  .
It was unable to induce significant endocytosis of the receptor .
Chemokines that could compete with high affinity for <prot>  MIP - 1beta </prot>  binding could also compete for monomeric <prot>  gp120 </prot>  binding , although with variable potencies ; maximal <p1  pair=15 >  <p1  pair=16 >  <prot>  gp120 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  binding inhibition was 80 % for <p2  pair=15 >  <prot>  MCP - 2 </prot>  </p2>  , but only 30 % for <p2  pair=16 >  <prot>  MIP - 1beta </prot>  </p2>  .
 <p1  pair=17 >  <prot> MCP - 3 </prot>  </p1>  could compete efficiently for <p2  pair=17 >  <prot>  gp120 </prot>  </p2>  binding but was , however , found to be a weak inhibitor of HIV infection , probably as a consequence of its inability to downregulate the receptor .

PG - 27975 - 80 AB - Previously , we mapped the novel CC chemokine <prot>  myeloid progenitor inhibitory factor 2 </prot>  ( <prot>  MPIF - 2 </prot>  ) / <prot>  eotaxin - 2 </prot>  to chromosome 7q11.23 ( Nomiyama , H. , Osborne , L. R. , Imai , T. , Kusuda , J. , Miura , R. , Tsui , L. - C. , and Yoshie , O. ( 1998 ) Genomics 49 , 339 - 340 ) .
Since chemokine genes tend to be clustered , unknown chemokines may be present in the vicinity of those mapped to new chromosomal loci .
Prompted by this hypothesis , we analyzed the genomic region containing the gene for <prot>  MPIF - 2 </prot>  / <prot>  eotaxin - 2 </prot>  ( <prot>  SCYA24 </prot>  ) and have identified a novel CC chemokine termed <prot>  eotaxin - 3 </prot>  .
The genes for <prot>  MPIF - 2 </prot>  / <prot>  eotaxin - 2 </prot>  ( <prot>  SCYA24 </prot>  ) and <prot>  eotaxin - 3 </prot>  ( <prot>  SCYA26 </prot>  ) are localized within a region of approximately 40 kilobases .
By Northern blot analysis , <prot>  eotaxin - 3 </prot>  mRNA was constitutively expressed in the heart and ovary .
We have generated recombinant <prot>  eotaxin - 3 </prot>  in a baculovirus expression system .
 <prot> Eotaxin - 3 </prot>  induced transient calcium mobilization specifically in <prot>  CC chemokine receptor 3 </prot>  ( <prot>  CCR3 </prot>  ) - expressing L1.2 cells with an EC ( 50 ) of 3 nM .
 <p1  pair=2 >  <prot> Eotaxin - 3 </prot>  </p1>  competed the binding of ( 125 ) <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  I - eotaxin </prot>  </p1>  to <p2  pair=2 >  <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  CCR3 </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  - expressing L1.2 cells with an IC ( 50 ) of 13 nM .
 <prot> Eotaxin - 3 </prot>  was chemotactic for normal peripheral blood eosinophils and basophils at high concentrations .
Collectively , <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  eotaxin - 3 </prot>  </p1>  is yet another functional ligand for <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  CCR3 </prot>  </p2>  .
The potency of <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  eotaxin - 3 </prot>  </p1>  as a <p1  pair=6 >  <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  CCR3 </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  ligand seems , however , to be approximately 10 - fold less than that of <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  eotaxin </prot>  </p2>  .
Identification of <prot>  eotaxin - 3 </prot>  will further promote our understanding of the control of eosinophil trafficking and other <prot>  CCR3 </prot>  - mediated biological phenomena .
The strategy used in this study may also be applicable to identification of other unknown chemokine genes .

PG - 121 - 34 AB - <prot>  Presenilin 1 </prot>  ( <prot>  PS1 </prot>  ) is the causative gene for an autosomal dominant familial Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) mapped to chromosome 14 .
Here we show that <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  QM </prot>  </p1>  / <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  Jun - interacting factor ( Jif ) - 1 </prot>  </p1>  , a negative regulator of <p2  pair=4 >  <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  c - Jun </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  , is a candidate to mediate the function of <prot>  PS1 </prot>  in the cell .
We screened for proteins that bind to <p1  pair=6 >  <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  PS1 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  from a human embryonic brain cDNA library using the two - hybrid method and isolated one clone encoding the <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  QM </prot>  </p2>  / <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  Jif - 1 </prot>  </p2>  gene .

By monitoring fluorescent recombinant protein and by gel mobility shift assays , <prot>  PS1 </prot>  was shown to accelerate the translocation of <prot>  QM </prot>  from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and to thereby suppress the binding of <p1  pair=12 >  <p2  pair=12 >  <prot>  c - Jun </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  homodimer to 12 - O - tetradecanoylphorbol - 13 - acetate ( TPA ) - responsive element ( TRE ) .

TI - Bone morphogenetic protein receptor complexes on the surface of live cells : a new oligomerization mode for serine / threonine kinase receptors .
PG - 1023 - 35 AB - The bone morphogenetic proteins ( BMPs ) play important roles in embryogenesis and normal cell growth .
The BMP receptors belong to the family of serine / threonine kinase receptors , whose activation has been investigated intensively for the <prot>  transforming growth factor - beta </prot>  ( <prot>  TGF - beta </prot>  ) receptor subfamily .
However , the interactions between the BMP receptors , the composition of the active receptor complex , and the role of the ligand in its formation have not yet been investigated and were usually assumed to follow the same pattern as the <prot>  TGF - beta </prot>  receptors .
Here we demonstrate that the oligomerization pattern of the BMP receptors is different and is more flexible and susceptible to modulation by ligand .
Using several complementary approaches , we investigated the formation of homomeric and heteromeric complexes between the two known BMP type I receptors ( <prot>  BR - Ia </prot>  and <prot>  BR - Ib </prot>  ) and the <prot>  BMP type II receptor </prot>  ( <prot>  BR - II </prot>  ) .
Coimmunoprecipitation studies detected the formation of heteromeric and homomeric complexes among all the BMP receptor types even in the absence of ligand .
These complexes were also detected at the cell surface after <prot>  BMP - 2 </prot>  binding and cross - linking .
Using antibody - mediated immunofluorescence copatching of epitope - tagged receptors , we provide evidence in live cells for preexisting heteromeric ( <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  BR - II </prot>  </p1>  / <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  BR - Ia </prot>  </p2>  and <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  BR - II </prot>  </p1>  / <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  BR - Ib </prot>  </p2>  ) and homomeric ( <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  BR - II </prot>  </p1>  / <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  BR - II </prot>  </p2>  , <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  BR - Ia </prot>  </p1>  / <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  BR - Ia </prot>  </p2>  , <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  BR - Ib </prot>  </p1>  / <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  BR - Ib </prot>  </p2>  , and also <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  BR - Ia </prot>  </p1>  / <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  BR - Ib </prot>  </p2>  ) oligomers in the absence of ligand .
 <p1  pair=8 >  <prot> BMP - 2 </prot>  </p1>  binding significantly increased hetero - and homo - oligomerization ( except for the <p1  pair=7 >  <p1  pair=9 >  <p2  pair=7 >  <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  BR - II </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  </p1>  </p1>  homo - oligomer , which binds ligand poorly in the absence of <p2  pair=9 >  <prot>  BR - I </prot>  </p2>  ) .
In contrast to previous observations on <prot>  TGF - beta </prot>  receptors , which were found to be fully homodimeric in the absence of ligand , the BMP receptors show a much more flexible oligomerization pattern .
This novel feature in the oligomerization mode of the BMP receptors allows higher variety and flexibility in their responses to various ligands as compared with the <prot>  TGF - beta </prot>  receptors .

TI - <prot>  TrkA </prot>  amino acids controlling specificity for nerve growth factor .
PG - 7870 - 7 AB - Neurotrophins are important for the development and maintenance of the vertebrate nervous system , mediating their signal into the cell by specific interaction with tyrosine kinase receptors of the Trk family .
The extracellular portion of the Trk receptors has been previously proposed to consist of a cysteine - rich motif , a leucine - rich motif , a second cysteine - rich motif followed by two immunoglobulin - like domains .
Earlier studies have shown that a major neurotrophin - binding site in the Trk receptors resides in the second immunoglobulin - like domain .
Although the individual amino acids in <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  TrkA </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  involved in binding to <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  nerve growth factor </prot>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  NGF </prot>  </p2>  ) and those in <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  TrkC </prot>  </p1>  involved in binding to <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  neurotrophin - 3 </prot>  </p2>  have been mapped in this domain , the Trk amino acids that provide specificity remained unclear .
In this study , a minimum set of residues in the human <prot>  TrkC </prot>  second immunoglobulin - like domain , which does not bind <prot>  nerve growth factor </prot>  ( <prot>  NGF </prot>  ) , were substituted with those from human <prot>  TrkA </prot>  .
The resulting Trk variant recruited binding of <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  NGF </prot>  </p1>  equivalent to <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  TrkA </prot>  </p2>  , maintained <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  neurotrophin - 3 </prot>  </p1>  binding equivalent to <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  TrkC </prot>  </p2>  , and also bound <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  brain - derived neurotrophin </prot>  </p1>  , although with lower affinity compared with <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  TrkB </prot>  </p2>  .
This implies that the amino acids in the second immunoglobulin - like domain that determine Trk specificity are distinct for each Trk .

TI - Characterization of the <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  CD30L </prot>  </p1>  binding domain on the human <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  CD30 </prot>  </p2>  molecule using anti - <prot>  CD30 </prot>  antibodies .

Several monoclonal antibodies ( MAbs ) have been developed against <prot>  CD30 </prot>  and , based on mutual inhibition assays , are grouped into three nonoverlapping serologic clusters .
However , the relationship between the epitopes recognized by the antibodies comprising each cluster and the binding domain for <prot>  CD30L </prot>  is not known .
Using a soluble <prot>  CD30L </prot>  / <prot>  CD8alpha </prot>  chimeric protein , we assessed the ability of anti - <prot>  CD30 </prot>  MAb to inhibit the binding of <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  CD30L </prot>  </p1>  to <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  CD30 </prot>  </p2>  expressed by the CD30+ Karpas 299 cell line .
 <p1  pair=5 >  <prot> CD30L </prot>  </p1>  binding by <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  CD30 </prot>  </p2>  is blocked by MAb that recognize epitopes belonging to cluster Group A ( like Ber - H2 , Ber - H8 , and HRS - 4 ) as well as cluster Group C ( like HeFi - 1 and M44 ) .
Cluster Group B antibodies , including M67 and Ki - 1 , do not affect <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  CD30L </prot>  </p1>  binding to <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  CD30 </prot>  </p2>  .
The pattern of <prot>  CD30L </prot>  binding inhibition shows only limited correspondence to the functional capacity of some anti - <prot>  CD30 </prot>  MAb to trigger <prot>  CD30 </prot>  signaling .

TI - Design , characterization , and structure of a biologically active single - chain mutant of human <prot>  IFN - gamma </prot>  .
PG - 169 - 79 AB - A mutant form of human <prot>  interferon - gamma </prot>  ( <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  <prot>  IFN - gamma </prot>  SC1 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  ) that binds one <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  <prot>  <prot>  IFN - gamma </prot>  receptor </prot>  alpha chain </prot>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  <prot>  IFN - gamma </prot>  R alpha </prot>  </p2>  ) has been designed and characterized .
 <prot>  <prot> IFN - gamma </prot>  SC1 </prot>  was derived by linking the two peptide chains of the <p1  pair=3 >  <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  IFN - gamma </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  dimer by a seven - residue linker and changing His111 in the first chain to an aspartic acid residue .
Isothermal titration calorimetry shows that <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  <prot>  IFN - gamma </prot>  SC1 </prot>  </p1>  forms a 1:1 complex with its high - affinity receptor ( <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  <prot>  IFN - gamma </prot>  R alpha </prot>  </p2>  ) with an affinity of 27 ( + / - 9 ) nM .
The crystal structure of <prot>  <prot>  IFN - gamma </prot>  SC1 </prot>  has been determined at 2.9 A resolution from crystals grown in 1.4 M citrate solutions at pH 7.6 .
Comparison of the wild - type receptor - binding domain and the Asp111 - containing domain of <prot>  <prot>  IFN - gamma </prot>  SC1 </prot>  show that they are structurally equivalent but have very different electrostatic surface potentials .
As a result , surface charge rather than structural changes is likely responsible for the inability of the His111 -- GTTTTT Asp domain of to bind <prot>  IFN - gamma R alpha </prot>  .
The AB loops of <prot>  IFN - gamma SC1 </prot>  adopt conformations similar to the ordered loops of <prot>  IFN - gamma </prot>  observed in the crystal structure of the <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  IFN - gamma </prot>  </p1>  / <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  <prot>  IFN - gamma </prot>  R alpha </prot>  </p2>  complex .
Thus , <prot>  <prot>  IFN - gamma </prot>  R alpha </prot>  binding does not result in a large conformational change in the AB loop as previously suggested .
The structure also reveals the final six C - terminal amino acid residues of <prot>  <prot>  IFN - gamma </prot>  SC1 </prot>  ( residues 253 - 258 ) that have not been observed in any other reported <prot>  IFN - gamma </prot>  structures .
Despite binding to only one <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  <prot>  IFN - gamma </prot>  R alpha </prot>  </p1>  , <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  IFN - gamma SC1 </prot>  </p2>  is biologically active in cell proliferation , MHC class I induction , and anti - viral assays .
This suggests that one domain of <p1  pair=7 >  <p1  pair=8 >  <prot>  IFN - gamma </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  is sufficient to recruit <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  <prot>  IFN - gamma </prot>  R alpha </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  IFN - gamma </prot>  R beta </p2>  into a complex competent for eliciting biological activity .
The current data are consistent with the main role of the <p1  pair=9 >  <p2  pair=9 >  <prot>  IFN - gamma </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  dimer being to decrease the dissociation constant of <prot>  IFN - gamma </prot>  for its cellular receptors .

PG - 3314 - 24 AB - <prot>  Bone morphogenetic protein - 2 </prot>  ( <prot>  BMP - 2 </prot>  ) induces bone formation and regeneration in adult vertebrates and regulates important developmental processes in all animals .
 <p1  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=1 >  <prot> BMP - 2 </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  is a homodimeric cysteine knot protein that , as a member of the <prot>  transforming growth factor - beta </prot>  ( <prot>  TGF - beta </prot>  ) superfamily , signals by oligomerizing type I and type II receptor serine - kinases in the cell membrane .
The binding epitopes of <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  BMP - 2 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  for <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  BMPR - IA </prot>  </p2>  ( type I ) and <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  BMPR - II </prot>  </p2>  or <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  ActR - II </prot>  </p2>  ( type II ) were characterized using <prot>  BMP - 2 </prot>  mutant proteins for analysis of interactions with receptor ectodomains .
A large epitope 1 for high - affinity <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  BMPR - IA </prot>  </p1>  binding was detected spanning the interface of the <p1  pair=5 >  <p2  pair=5 >  <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  BMP - 2 </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  </p1>  dimer .
A smaller epitope 2 for the low - affinity binding of <prot>  BMPR - II </prot>  was found to be assembled by determinants of a single monomer .
Symmetry - related pairs of the two juxtaposed epitopes occur near the <prot>  BMP - 2 </prot>  poles .
Mutations in both epitopes yielded variants with reduced biological activity in C2C12 cells ; however , only epitope 2 variants behaved as antagonists partially or completely inhibiting <prot>  BMP - 2 </prot>  activity .
These findings provide a framework for the molecular description of receptor recognition and activation in the BMP / <prot>  TGF - beta </prot>  superfamily .

 <prot> BMP - 2 </prot>  can induce ectopic bone and cartilage formation in adult vertebrates and is involved in central steps in early embryonal development in animals .
Signaling by these cytokines requires binding of two types of transmembrane serine / threonine receptor kinase chains classified as type I and type II .

No contacts exist between the receptor domains .
The model reveals the structural basis for discrimination between type I and type II receptors and the variability of receptor - ligand interactions that is seen in BMP - <prot>  TGF - beta </prot>  systems .

PG - 840 - 5 AB - <prot>  Liver - expressed chemokine </prot>  ( <prot>  LEC </prot>  ) is an unusually large CC chemokine , which is also known as <prot>  LMC </prot>  , <prot>  HCC - 4 </prot>  , <prot>  NCC - 4 </prot>  , and <prot>  CCL16 </prot>  .
Previously , <prot>  LEC </prot>  was shown to induce leukocyte migration but the responsible signaling receptors were not characterized .
We report chemotaxis and competitive binding studies that show <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  LEC </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  binds to and activates <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  CCR1 </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  CCR8 </prot>  </p2>  transfected HEK - 293 cells .
 <prot> LEC </prot>  induced maximal migration of <prot>  CCR1 </prot>  and <prot>  CCR8 </prot>  transfected cells at 89.3 nmol / L and cell adhesion at 5.6 nmol / L .
The molar concentration of <prot>  LEC </prot>  required to induce maximum cell migration is 20 - to 200 - fold greater than that required for <prot>  RANTES </prot>  or <prot>  I309 </prot>  , respectively .
All 3 chemokines induced maximal static adhesion at 5 to 7 nmol / L .
A neutralizing polyclonal antibody to <prot>  LEC </prot>  was developed to demonstrate that the unusually high concentration of <prot>  LEC </prot>  required to induce chemotaxis was a property of <prot>  LEC </prot>  and not as a result of an irrelevant protein contamination .
This study suggests that <prot>  LEC </prot>  may be a more effective inducer of cell adhesion than cell migration .

TI - Identification of residues important both for primary receptor binding and specificity in <prot>  fibroblast growth factor - 7 </prot>  .
PG - 34881 - 6 AB - Fibroblast growth factors ( FGFs ) mediate a multitude of physiological and pathological processes by activating a family of tyrosine kinase receptors ( FGFRs ) .
Each FGFR binds to a unique subset of FGFs and ligand binding specificity is essential in regulating FGF activity .
 <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <prot> FGF - 7 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  recognizes one FGFR isoform known as the <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  FGFR2 IIIb </prot>  </p2>  isoform or <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  <prot>  keratinocyte growth factor </prot>  receptor </prot>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  KGFR </prot>  </p2>  ) , whereas <p1  pair=4 >  <p1  pair=5 >  <p1  pair=6 >  <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  FGF - 2 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  binds well to <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  FGFR1 </prot>  </p2>  , <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  FGFR2 </prot>  </p2>  , and <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  FGFR4 </prot>  </p2>  but interacts poorly with <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  KGFR </prot>  </p2>  .
Previously , mutations in <prot>  FGF - 2 </prot>  identified a set of residues that are important for high affinity receptor binding , known as the primary receptor - binding site .
 <p1  pair=8 >  <prot> FGF - 7 </prot>  </p1>  contains this primary site as well as a region that restricts interaction with <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  FGFR1 </prot>  </p2>  .
The sequences that confer on <p1  pair=9 >  <prot>  FGF - 7 </prot>  </p1>  its specific binding to <p2  pair=9 >  <prot>  KGFR </prot>  </p2>  have not been identified .
By utilizing domain swapping and site - directed mutagenesis we have found that the loop connecting the beta4 - beta5 strands of <p1  pair=10 >  <prot>  FGF - 7 </prot>  </p1>  contributes to high affinity receptor binding and is critical for <p2  pair=10 >  <prot>  KGFR </prot>  </p2>  recognition .
Replacement of this loop with the homologous loop from <prot>  FGF - 2 </prot>  dramatically reduced both the affinity of <p1  pair=11 >  <prot>  FGF7 </prot>  </p1>  for <p2  pair=11 >  <prot>  KGFR </prot>  </p2>  and its biological potency but did not result in the ability to bind <prot>  FGFR1 </prot>  .
Point mutations in residues comprising this loop of <prot>  FGF - 7 </prot>  reduced both binding affinity and biological potency .
The reciprocal loop replacement mutant ( <prot>  FGF2 </prot>  - L4 / 7 ) retained <p1  pair=12 >  <p1  pair=13 >  <prot>  FGF - 2 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  like affinity for <p2  pair=12 >  <prot>  FGFR1 </prot>  </p2>  and for <p2  pair=13 >  <prot>  KGFR </prot>  </p2>  .
Our results show that topologically similar regions in these two FGFs have different roles in regulating receptor binding specificity and suggest that specificity may require the concerted action of distinct regions of an FGF .

TI - New structural and functional aspects of the <prot>  type I interferon - receptor </prot>  interaction revealed by comprehensive mutational analysis of the binding interface .
PG - 40425 - 33 AB - Type I interferons bind to two cell surface receptors , <prot>  ifnar1 </prot>  and <prot>  ifnar2 </prot>  , as the first step in the activation of several signal transduction pathways that elicit an anti - viral state and an anti - proliferative response .
Here , we quantitatively mapped the complete binding region of <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  ifnar2 </prot>  </p1>  on <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  interferon ( IFN ) alpha2 </prot>  </p2>  by 35 individual mutations to alanine and isosteric residues .
Of the six AMPPPP quot ; hot - spot AMPPPP quot ; residues identified ( Leu - 30 , Arg - 33 , Arg - 144 , Ala - 145 , Met - 148 , and Arg - 149 ) , four are located on the E - helix , which is located at the center of the binding site flanked by residues on the A - helix and the AB - loop .
The contribution of residues of the D - helix , which have been previously implicated in binding , proved to be marginal for the interaction with the extracellular domain of <prot>  ifnar2 </prot>  .
Interestingly , the <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  ifnar2 </prot>  </p1>  binding site overlaps the largest continuous hydrophobic patch on <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  IFNalpha2 </prot>  </p2>  .
Thus , hydrophobic interactions seem to play a significant role stabilizing this interaction , with the charged residues contributing toward the rapid association of the complex .
Relating the anti - viral and anti - proliferative activity of the various interferon mutants with their affinity toward <prot>  ifnar2 </prot>  results in linear function over the whole range of affinities investigated , suggesting that <prot>  ifnar2 </prot>  binding is the rate - determining step in cellular activation .
Dose - time analysis of the anti - viral response revealed that shortening the incubation time of low - level activation cannot be compensated by higher IFN doses .
Considering the strict dependence of the cellular response on affinity , these results suggest that for maintaining transcription of IFN - responsive genes over a longer time period , low but continuous signaling through the IFN receptor is essential .

TI - Crystal structure of fibroblast growth factor receptor ectodomain bound to ligand and heparin .
PG - 1029 - 34 AB - Fibroblast growth factors ( FGFs ) are a large family of structurally related proteins with a wide range of physiological and pathological activities .
Signal transduction requires association of FGF with its receptor tyrosine kinase ( FGFR ) and heparan sulphate proteoglycan in a specific complex on the cell surface .
Direct involvement of the heparan sulphate glycosaminoglycan polysaccharide in the molecular association between FGF and its receptor is essential for biological activity .
Although crystal structures of binary complexes of FGF - heparin and FGF - FGFR have been described , the molecular architecture of the FGF signalling complex has not been elucidated .
Here we report the crystal structure of the <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  FGFR2 </prot>  </p1>  ectodomain in a dimeric form that is induced by simultaneous binding to <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  FGF1 </prot>  </p2>  and a heparin decasaccharide .
The complex is assembled around a central heparin molecule linking two FGF1 ligands into a dimer that bridges between two receptor chains .
The asymmetric heparin binding involves contacts with both FGF1 molecules but only one receptor chain .
The structure of the <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  FGF1 </prot>  </p1>  - <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  FGFR2 </prot>  </p2>  - heparin ternary complex provides a structural basis for the essential role of heparan sulphate in FGF signalling .

TI - Loss of <prot>  fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 </prot>  ligand - binding specificity in Apert syndrome .
PG - 14536 - 41 AB - Craniosynostosis syndromes are autosomal dominant human skeletal diseases that result from various mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor genes ( Fgfrs ) .
Apert syndrome ( AS ) is one of the most severe craniosynostosis syndromes and is associated with severe syndactyly of the hands and feet and with central nervous system malformations .
AS is caused by specific missense mutations in one of two adjacent amino acid residues ( S252W or P253R ) in the highly conserved region linking Ig - like domains II and III of <prot>  FGFR2 </prot>  .
Here we demonstrate that these mutations break one of the cardinal rules governing ligand specificity of <prot>  FGFR2 </prot>  .
We show that the S252W mutation allows the mesenchymal splice form of <prot>  FGFR2 </prot>  ( <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  FGFR2c </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  ) to bind and to be activated by the mesenchymally expressed ligands <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  FGF7 </prot>  </p2>  or <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  FGF10 </prot>  </p2>  and the epithelial splice form of <prot>  FGFR2 </prot>  ( <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  FGFR2b </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  ) to be activated by <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  FGF2 </prot>  </p2>  , <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  FGF6 </prot>  </p2>  , and <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  FGF9 </prot>  </p2>  .
These data demonstrate loss of ligand specificity of <prot>  FGFR2 </prot>  with retained ligand dependence for receptor activation .
These data suggest that the severe phenotypes of AS likely result from ectopic ligand - dependent activation of <prot>  FGFR2 </prot>  .

Kaposi 's sarcoma - associated herpesvirus encodes a functional homolog of human <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  interleukin - 6 </prot>  </p1>  ( <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  </p1>  ) that activates human <p2  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  gp130 </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  .
In the 2.4 angstrom crystal structure of the extracellular signaling assembly between viral <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  </p1>  and human <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  gp130 </prot>  </p2>  , two complexes are cross - linked into a tetramer through direct interactions between the immunoglobulin domain of <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  gp130 </prot>  </p1>  and site III of viral <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  </p2>  , which is necessary for receptor activation .
Unlike human <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  </p1>  ( which uses many hydrophilic residues ) , the viral cytokine largely uses hydrophobic amino acids to contact <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  gp130 </prot>  </p2>  , which enhances the complementarity of the viral <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  </p1>  - <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  gp130 </prot>  </p2>  binding interfaces .

PG - 27406 - 14 AB - We have characterized <prot>  platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ) C </prot>  , a novel growth factor belonging to the PDGF family .
 <prot> PDGF - C </prot>  is a multidomain protein with the N - terminal region homologous to the extracellular CUB domain of <prot>  neuropilin - 1 </prot>  , and the C - terminal region consists of a growth factor domain ( GFD ) with homology to vascular <prot>  endothelial growth factor </prot>  ( 25 % ) and <prot>  PDGF A </prot>  - chain ( 23 % ) .
A serum - sensitive cleavage site between the two domains allows release of the GFD from the CUB domain .
Competition binding and immunoprecipitation studies on cells bearing both <prot>  PDGF alpha </prot>  and beta receptors reveal a high affinity binding of recombinant GFD ( <p1  pair=5 >  <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  PDGF - CC </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  ) to <p1  pair=7 >  <p2  pair=5 >  <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  PDGF receptor - alpha </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  </p1>  homodimers and <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  PDGF receptor - alpha </prot>  </p2>  / beta heterodimers .

Here , we investigated its receptor usage by calcium mobilization and chemotactic assays using mouse L1.2 pre - B cell lines stably expressing a panel of 12 human chemokine receptors .
At relatively high concentrations , <p1  pair=7 >  <p1  pair=8 >  <prot>  LEC </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  induced calcium mobilization and chemotaxis via <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  CCR1 </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  CCR2 </prot>  </p2>  .

The binding of <p1  pair=13 >  <prot>  LEC </prot>  </p1>  to <p2  pair=13 >  <prot>  CCR8 </prot>  </p2>  was much less significant .
In spite of its binding to <p1  pair=14 >  <prot>  CCR5 </prot>  </p1>  , <p2  pair=14 >  <prot>  LEC </prot>  </p2>  was unable to inhibit infection of an R5 - type HIV - 1 to activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells even at high concentrations .

HepG2 , a human hepatocarcinoma cell line , was found to constitutively express <prot>  LEC </prot>  .
 <prot> LEC </prot>  was also present in the plasma samples from healthy adult donors at relatively high concentrations ( 0.3 -- 4 nM ) .

PG - 2902 - 8 AB - A rabbit reticulocyte lysate system that has been used to reconstitute functional complexes between steroid receptors and the 90 - kDa heat shock protein ( <prot>  hsp90 </prot>  ) has been used here to form complexes between the <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  pp60src </prot>  </p1>  tyrosine kinase and <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  hsp90 </prot>  </p2>  .
Reticulocyte lysate forms complexes between <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  hsp90 </prot>  </p1>  and a temperature - sensitive mutant of Rous sarcoma virus <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  pp60v - src </prot>  </p2>  , which is normally present in cytosol virtually entirely in the multiprotein complex form .

Moreover , the reticulocyte lysate - reconstituted complex also contains the 50 - kDa phosphoprotein component of the native <prot>  pp60v - src </prot>  multiprotein complex .
The native and reconstituted <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  pp60src </prot>  </p1>  - <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  hsp90 </prot>  </p2>  complexes have similar thermal stability and , like steroid receptor heterocomplexes , they are stabilized by molybdate .
As previously shown with reticulocyte lysate - reconstituted steroid receptor heteroprotein complexes , the reconstituted <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  pp60src </prot>  </p1>  multiprotein complex contains <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  hsp70 </prot>  </p2>  , which is a major candidate for providing the protein unfoldase activity required for <prot>  hsp90 </prot>  association .

TI - The SH2 and SH3 domain - containing protein <prot>  GRB2 </prot>  links receptor tyrosine kinases to ras signaling .
PG - 431 - 42 AB - A cDNA clone encoding a novel , widely expressed protein ( called <prot>  growth factor receptor - bound protein 2 </prot>  or <prot>  GRB2 </prot>  ) containing one src homology 2 ( SH2 ) domain and two SH3 domains was isolated .
Immunoblotting experiments indicate that <prot>  GRB2 </prot>  associates with tyrosine - phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptors ( EGFRs ) and platelet - derived growth factor receptors ( PDGFRs ) via its SH2 domain .
Interestingly , <prot>  GRB2 </prot>  exhibits striking structural and functional homology to the C. elegans protein sem - 5 .
It has been shown that sem - 5 and two other genes called let - 23 ( EGFR like ) and let - 60 ( ras like ) lie along the same signal transduction pathway controlling C. elegans vulval induction .
To examine whether <prot>  GRB2 </prot>  is also a component of ras signaling in mammalian cells , microinjection studies were performed .
While injection of <prot>  GRB2 </prot>  or <prot>  H - ras </prot>  proteins alone into quiescent rat fibroblasts did not have mitogenic effect , microinjection of <prot>  GRB2 </prot>  together with <prot>  H - ras </prot>  protein stimulated DNA synthesis .
These results suggest that <prot>  GRB2 </prot>  / <prot>  sem - 5 </prot>  plays a crucial role in a highly conserved mechanism for growth factor control of ras signaling .

PG - 17498 - 501 AB - Members of the helix - loop - helix ( HLH ) family of proteins bind DNA and activate transcription as homo - and heterodimers .
 <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <prot> Myogenin </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  is a muscle - specific HLH protein that binds DNA in vitro as a heterodimer with several widely expressed HLH proteins , such as the <prot>  E2A </prot>  gene products <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  E12 </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  E47 </prot>  </p2>  .
We describe a method for detection of protein - protein interactions among HLH proteins in vivo in which dimerization through the HLH motif reconstructs a hybrid transcription factor containing the DNA - binding domain of yeast GAL4 linked to one HLH motif and the activation domain of <prot>  VP - 16 </prot>  linked to another .
We have used this assay to investiagate whether myogenin forms homomeric or heteromeric complexes in vivo and to determine whether growth factors and oncogenes that inhibit myogenesis influence myogenin 's ability to dimerize .
The results show that <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  myogenin </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  heterodimerizes with <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  E12 </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  E47 </prot>  </p2>  in vivo , but it does not homodimerize to a measurable extent .
Peptide growth factors , as well as the immediate early gene products <prot>  c - Jun </prot>  , <prot>  v - Fos </prot>  , and <prot>  c - Myc </prot>  , inhibit the activity of myogenin through a mechanism independent of its association with <prot>  E2A </prot>  products .

The <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  v - Raf </prot>  </p1>  proteins purified from cells infected with EC12 or 22W viruses activated <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  <prot>  MAP kinase </prot>  kinase </prot>  </p2>  from skeletal muscle in vitro .
Furthermore , a bacterially expressed <prot>  v - Raf </prot>  fusion protein ( glutathione S - transferase - p3722W ) also activated <prot>  <prot>  MAP kinase </prot>  kinase </prot>  in vitro .
These findings suggest that one function of <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  c - Raf - 1 </prot>  </p1>  in mitogenic signaling is to phosphorylate and activate <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  <prot>  MAP kinase </prot>  kinase </prot>  </p2>  .

PG - 21172 - 8 AB - An expression plasmid encoding the human 75 - kDa <prot>  tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) type 2 receptor </prot>  ( <prot>  TNF - R2 </prot>  ) was constructed and used to generate a stable human cell line ( 293 / <prot>  TNF - R2 </prot>  ) overexpressing <prot>  TNF - R2 </prot>  .
Ligand binding analysis revealed high affinity binding ( Kd = 0.2 nM ) with approximately 94 , 000 + / - 7 , 500 sites / cell for 125I - <prot>  TNF - alpha </prot>  and approximately 5 - fold lower affinity for <prot>  TNF - beta </prot>  ( Kd = 1.1 nM ) with 264 , 000 + / - 2 , 000 sites / cell .
Cross - linking of 125I - <prot>  TNF - alpha </prot>  and 125I - <prot>  TNF - beta </prot>  to 293 / <prot>  TNF - R2 </prot>  cells yielded predominant complexes with apparent molecular weights of 211 , 000 for <prot>  TNF - alpha </prot>  and 205 , 000 and 244 , 000 for <prot>  TNF - beta </prot>  , suggesting these complexes contain two or three <prot>  TNF - R2 </prot>  molecules .
Immunoprecipitation of <prot>  TNF - R2 </prot>  from 32P - labeled 293 / <prot>  TNF - R2 </prot>  cells demonstrated that the receptor is phosphorylated .
The majority ( 97 % ) of 32Pi incorporation was found in serine residues with a very low level of incorporation ( 3 % ) in threonine residues .
 <prot> TNF - alpha </prot>  treatment of 293 / <prot>  TNF - R2 </prot>  cells did not significantly affect the degree or pattern of phosphorylation .
Cell surface - bound 125I - TNF - alpha was slowly internalized by the 293 / <prot>  TNF - R2 </prot>  cell line with a t1 / 2 = 25 min .

PG - 2514 - 7 AB - In the present report , we demonstrated that modulation of <prot>  CD26 </prot>  from T cell surface induced by anti <prot>  CD26 </prot>  ( 1F7 ) led to enhanced phosphorylation of <prot>  CD3 </prot>  zeta tyrosine residues and increased <prot>  CD4 </prot>  associated p56lck tyrosine kinase activity .
We further showed that <prot>  CD26 </prot>  was comodulated on the T cell surface with <prot>  CD45 </prot>  , a known membrane - linked protein tyrosine phosphatase and that anti - <prot>  CD26 </prot>  was capable of precipitating <prot>  CD45 </prot>  from T cell lysates .
These findings strongly suggest that <prot>  CD26 </prot>  may be closely associated with the <prot>  CD45 </prot>  protein tyrosine phosphatase on T cell surface and further support the notion that the interaction of <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  CD26 </prot>  </p1>  with <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  CD45 </prot>  </p2>  results in enhanced tyrosine kinase activity , zeta chain phosphorylation , and T cell activation .

PG - 197 - 208 AB - We have isolated and characterized a cDNA clone , <prot>  phFGFR </prot>  , encoding a human fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) receptor. <prot>  phFGFR </prot>  contains an open reading frame which encodes an 820 amino acid polypeptide with three immunoglobulin - like domains in the extracellular part and an intracellular split tyrosine kinase domain .
Transient expression in COS - 1 cells and immunoprecipitation using an antiserum raised against a C - terminal peptide , gave rise to two components , representing mature ( 130 kDa ) and precursor ( 115 kDa ) forms of the <prot>  phFGFR </prot>  encoded polypeptide , which was denoted <prot>  hFGFR - 1 </prot>  .
Crosslinking of iodinated <prot>  acidic FGF </prot>  ( <prot>  aFGF </prot>  ) and <prot>  basic FGF </prot>  ( <prot>  bFGF </prot>  ) to transiently expressing COS - 1 cells revealed a major band of 95 kDa , which was competed for by both <prot>  aFGF </prot>  and <prot>  bFGF </prot>  .
From Scatchard analyses , the Kd :s for binding of <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  aFGF </prot>  </p1>  and <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  bFGF </prot>  </p1>  to <p2  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  hFGFR - 1 </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  were estimated to 25 pM and 41 pM , respectively .
Thus , <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  phFGFR </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  encodes a human FGF receptor with high affinity for both <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  aFGF </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  bFGF </prot>  </p2>  .

PG - 3720 - 4 AB - The <prot>  Fos </prot>  / <prot>  Jun </prot>  and <prot>  ATF </prot>  / <prot>  CREB </prot>  families of transcription factors function in coupling extracellular signals to alterations in expression of specific target genes .
Like many eukaryotic transcription factors , these proteins bind to DNA as dimers .
Dimerization is mediated by a structure known as the AMPPPP quot ; leucine - zipper AMPPPP quot ; motif .
Although <prot>  Fos </prot>  / <prot>  Jun </prot>  and <prot>  ATF </prot>  / <prot>  CREB </prot>  were previously thought to interact preferentially with different DNA regulatory elements ( the AP - 1 / TRE and ATF / CRE sites , respectively ) , we find that members of these two families form selective cross - family heterodimers .
The resulting heterodimers display distinguishable DNA binding specificities from each other and from their parental homodimers .
These findings indicate that the <prot>  Fos </prot>  / <prot>  Jun </prot>  and <prot>  ATF </prot>  / <prot>  CREB </prot>  families of transcription factors are not as distinct as was previously thought .
We suggest that they can be grouped into a superfamily of transcription factors .

PG - 3311 - 9 AB - Activation of the <prot>  cdc2 </prot>  protein kinase at different stages of the cell cycle is regulated by post - translational modifications and interactions with cyclins .
We show that in vitro translated human <prot>  cdc2 </prot>  binds very poorly to A and B cyclins , unless it has been preincubated with a Xenopus egg extract .
This results in the phosphorylation of <prot>  cdc2 </prot>  which allows binding to cyclins .
The replacement of Thr161 , a residue conserved and phosphorylated in other protein kinases , with valine inhibits <prot>  cdc2 </prot>  association with A and B cyclins .
In addition , mutations in the amino - terminus of <prot>  cdc2 </prot>  and within the conserved ' PSTAIR ' region strongly inhibit binding .
The Thr161Val mutation causes a lethal phenotype in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe , while replacement of Thr161 with glutamic acid , potentially mimicking phosphorylation , causes uncoordination of mitosis and multiple cytokinesis .
These results suggest that a threonine phosphorylation / dephosphorylation cycle is involved in regulating <prot>  cdc2 </prot>  function .

Both genes rescue a cdc25ts mutant of fission yeast .
Microinjection of anti - <prot>  cdc25A </prot>  antibodies into HeLa cells causes their arrest in mitosis. <prot>  cdc25A </prot>  and <prot>  cdc25B </prot>  display endogenous tyrosine phosphatase activity that is stimulated several - fold , in the absence of cdc2 , by stoichiometric addition of either <prot>  cyclin B1 </prot>  or B2 but not A or D1 .

These findings indicate that B - type cyclins are multifunctional proteins that not only act as M phase regulatory subunits of the <prot>  cdc2 </prot>  protein kinase , but also activate the <prot>  cdc25 </prot>  tyrosine phosphatase , of which <prot>  cdc2 </prot>  is the physiological substrate .
A region of amino acid similarity between cyclins and tyrosine PTPases has been detected .
This region is absent in <prot>  cdc25 </prot>  phosphatases .

These three sites are nested within a single tryptic peptide located just upstream of the basic region of the <prot>  c - Jun </prot>  DNA - binding domain ( residues 227 - 252 ) .
Activation of <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  protein kinase C </prot>  </p1>  results in rapid , site - specific dephosphorylation of <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  c - Jun </prot>  </p2>  at one or more of these three sites and is coincident with increased <prot>  AP - 1 </prot>  - binding activity .
Phosphorylation of recombinant human <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  c - Jun </prot>  </p1>  proteins in vitro by <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  GSK - 3 </prot>  </p2>  decreases their DNA - binding activity .
Mutation of serine 243 to phenylalanine blocks phosphorylation of all three sites in vivo and increases the inherent trans - activation ability of <prot>  c - Jun </prot>  at least 10 - fold .
We propose that <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  c - Jun </prot>  </p1>  is present in resting cells in a latent , phosphorylated form that can be activated by site - specific dephosphorylation in response to <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  protein kinase C </prot>  </p2>  activation .

PG - 14188 - 92 AB - The <prot>  type II cAMP - dependent protein kinase </prot>  is localized to specific subcellular environments through the binding of the regulatory subunit ( <p1  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  RII </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  ) dimer to <prot>  RII </prot>  - anchoring proteins .
Computer - aided analysis of secondary structure , performed on four <prot>  RII </prot>  - anchoring protein sequences ( the <prot>  microtubule - associated protein 2 </prot>  , <prot>  P150 </prot>  , and two thyroid proteins <prot>  Ht 21 </prot>  and <prot>  Ht 31 </prot>  ) , has identified common regions of approximately 14 residues which display high probabilities of forming amphipathic helices .
The potential amphipathic helix region of <prot>  Ht 31 </prot>  ( Leu - Ile - Glu - Glu - Ala - Ala - Ser - Arg - Ile - Val - Asp - Ala - Val - Ile ) lies between residues 494 and 507 .
A bacterially expressed 318 - amino acid fragment , <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  Ht 31 </prot>  </p1>  ( 418 - 736 ) , containing the amphipathic helix region , was able to bind <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  <prot>  RII </prot>  alpha </prot>  </p2>  .
Site - directed mutagenesis designed to disrupt the secondary structure in the putative binding helix reduced binding dramatically .
Specifically , substitution of proline for Ala - 498 significantly diminished <prot>  <prot>  RII </prot>  alpha </prot>  binding , and similar mutation of Ile - 502 or Ile - 507 abolished interaction .
Mutation of Ala - 522 to proline , which is located outside the predicted amphipathic helix region , had no effect on <prot>  <prot>  RII </prot>  alpha </prot>  binding .
These data suggest that anchoring proteins interact with <prot>  <prot>  RII </prot>  alpha </prot>  via an amphipathic helix binding motif .

The <prot>  c - jun </prot>  protein is negatively regulated by phosphorylation of residues near the carboxy terminus which are dephosphorylated in response to phorbol esters .
Here we identify two serine residues in the amino terminal A1 transactivation domain which are phosphorylated in response to a variety of mitogens , phorbol esters and activated <prot>  ras </prot>  .
We present evidence that <prot>  mitogen - activated protein - serine ( MAP ) kinases </prot>  ( <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  pp54 </prot>  </p1>  and <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  pp42 </prot>  </p1>  / 44 ) specifically phosphorylate these sites and that their phosphorylation positively regulates the transacting activity of <p2  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  c - jun </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  .

TI - A cellular protein that competes with <prot>  SV40 T antigen </prot>  for binding to the <prot>  retinoblastoma </prot>  gene product .
PG - 160 - 2 AB - Tumour - suppressor genes , such as the human <prot>  retinoblastoma susceptibility gene </prot>  ( <prot>  Rb </prot>  ) , are widely recognized as being vital in the control of cell growth and tumour formation .
This role is indicated , in part , by the suppression of tumorigenicity of human tumour cells after retrovirus - mediated <prot>  Rb </prot>  replacement .
How <prot>  Rb </prot>  acts to bring about this suppression is not clear but one clue is that the <prot>  Rb </prot>  protein forms complexes with the transforming oncoproteins of several DNA tumour viruses , and that two regions of <prot>  Rb </prot>  essential for such binding frequently contain mutations in tumour cells .
These observations suggest that endogenous cellular proteins might exist that bind to the same regions of <prot>  Rb </prot>  and thereby mediate its function .
We report here the identification of one such human cellular <prot>  <prot>  Rb </prot>  - associated protein </prot>  of relative molecular mass 46 , 000 ( 46K ) ( <prot>  RbAP46 </prot>  ) .
Two lines of evidence support the notion that <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  RbAP46 </prot>  </p1>  and <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  simian virus 40 T antigen </prot>  </p1>  have homologous <p2  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  Rb </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  - binding properties : first , several mutated <prot>  Rb </prot>  proteins that failed to bind to T also did not associate with <prot>  RbAP46 </prot>  ; and second , both T antigen and T peptide ( amino acids 101 - 118 ) were able to compete with <prot>  RbAP46 </prot>  for binding to <prot>  Rb </prot>  .
The apparent targeting of the <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  RbAP46 </prot>  </p1>  - <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  Rb </prot>  </p2>  interaction by oncoproteins of DNA tumour viruses strongly suggests that formation of this complex is functionally important .

TI - Molecular cloning and expression of a receptor for human tumor necrosis factor .
PG - 361 - 70 AB - A human tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) binding protein from serum of cancer patients was purified to homogeneity and partially sequenced .
Synthetic DNA probes based on amino acid sequence information were used to isolate cDNA clones encoding a receptor for TNF .
The TNF receptor ( TNF - R ) is a 415 amino acid polypeptide with a single membrane - spanning region .
The extracellular cysteine - rich domain of the TNF - R is homologous to the nerve growth factor receptor and the <prot>  B cell activation protein </prot>  <prot>  Bp50 </prot>  .
Human embryonic kidney cells transfected with a TNF - R expression vector specifically bind both 125I - labeled and biotinylated <prot>  TNF - alpha </prot>  .
Unlabeled <prot>  TNF - alpha </prot>  and <prot>  TNF - beta </prot>  were equally effective at displacing the binding of labeled <prot>  TNF - alpha </prot>  to TNF - R expressing cells .
Northern analysis indicates a single species of mRNA for the TNF - R in a variety of cell types .
Therefore , the soluble TNF binding protein found in human serum is probably proteolytically derived from the TNF - R .

PG - 3667 - 76 AB - Two cDNA clones encoding a receptor for human <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor </prot>  </p1>  ( <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  hGM - CSF - R </prot>  </p2>  ) were isolated by expression screening of a library made from human placental mRNA .
Pools of recombinant plasmid DNA were electroporated into COS cells which were then screened for their capacity to bind radioiodinated hGM - CSF using a sensitive microscopic autoradiographic approach .
The cloned <prot>  GM - CSF - R </prot>  precursor is a 400 amino acid polypeptide ( Mr 45 , 000 ) with a single transmembrane domain , a glycosylated extracellular domain and a short ( 54 amino acids ) intracytoplasmic tail .
It does not contain a tyrosine kinase domain nor show homology with members of the immunoglobulin super gene family , but does show some significant sequence homologies with receptors for several other haemopoietic growth factors , including those for <prot>  interleukin - 6 </prot>  , <prot>  erythropoietin </prot>  and <prot>  interleukin - 2 </prot>  ( beta - chain ) and also to the prolactin receptor .
When transfected into COS cells the cloned cDNA directed the expression of a <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  GM - CSF - R </prot>  </p1>  showing a single class of affinity ( KD = 2 ( - 8 ) nM ) and specificity for human <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  GM - CSF </prot>  </p2>  but not <prot>  interleukin - 3 </prot>  .
Messenger RNA coding for this receptor was detected in a variety of haemopoietic cells known to display <prot>  hGM - CSF </prot>  binding , and cross - linking experiments revealed a similar size for the glycosylated receptors in transfected COS and haemopoietic cells .

PG - 2862 - 70 AB - <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  CD5 </prot>  </p1>  is a T - cell - specific antigen which binds to the B - cell antigen <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  CD72 </prot>  </p2>  and acts as a coreceptor in the stimulation of T - cell growth .

However , despite this , the mechanism by which <prot>  CD5 </prot>  generates intracellular signals is unclear .
In this study , we demonstrate that <p1  pair=6 >  <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  CD5 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  is coupled to the protein - tyrosine kinase <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  p56lck </prot>  </p2>  and can act as a substrate for <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  p56lck </prot>  </p2>  .
Coexpression of <prot>  CD5 </prot>  with <prot>  p56lck </prot>  in the baculovirus expression system resulted in the phosphorylation of <prot>  CD5 </prot>  on tyrosine residues .
Further , anti - <prot>  CD5 </prot>  and anti - <prot>  p56lck </prot>  coprecipitated each other in a variety of detergents , including Nonidet P - 40 and Triton X - 100 .
Anti - <prot>  CD5 </prot>  also precipitated the kinase from various T cells irrespective of the expression of <prot>  TcR zeta </prot>  / <prot>  CD3 </prot>  or <prot>  CD4 </prot>  .
No binding between <prot>  p59fyn </prot>  ( T ) and <prot>  CD5 </prot>  was detected in T cells .
The binding of <p1  pair=8 >  <prot>  p56lck </prot>  </p1>  to <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  CD5 </prot>  </p2>  induced a 10 - to 15 - fold increase in <prot>  p56lck </prot>  catalytic activity , as measured by in vitro kinase analysis .
In vivo labelling with 32P ( i ) also showed a four - to fivefold increase in Y - 394 occupancy in <p1  pair=9 >  <prot>  p56lck </prot>  </p1>  when associated with <p2  pair=9 >  <prot>  CD5 </prot>  </p2>  .
The use of glutathione S - transferase - Lck fusion proteins in precipitation analysis showed that the SH2 domain of <p1  pair=10 >  <prot>  p56lck </prot>  </p1>  could recognize <p2  pair=10 >  <prot>  CD5 </prot>  </p2>  as expressed in the baculovirus expression system .

TI - Making a connection : direct binding between keratin intermediate filaments and desmosomal proteins .
PG - 1049 - 60 AB - In epidermal cells , keratin intermediate filaments connect with desmosomes to form extensive cadherin - mediated cytoskeletal architectures .
 <prot> Desmoplakin </prot>  ( <prot>  DPI </prot>  ) , a desmosomal component lacking a transmembrane domain , has been implicated in this interaction , although most studies have been conducted with cells that contain few or no desmosomes , and efforts to demonstrate direct interactions between desmoplakin and intermediate filaments have not been successful .
In this report , we explore the biochemical nature of the connections between keratin filaments and desmosomes in epidermal keratinocytes .
We show that the carboxy terminal AMPPPP quot ; tail AMPPPP quot ; of <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  DPI </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  associates directly with the amino terminal AMPPPP quot ; head AMPPPP quot ; of type II epidermal keratins , including <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  K1 </prot>  </p2>  , <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  K2 </prot>  </p2>  , <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  K5 </prot>  </p2>  , and <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  K6 </prot>  </p2>  .
We have engineered and purified recombinant <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  K5 </prot>  </p1>  head and <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  DPI </prot>  </p2>  tail , and we demonstrate direct interaction in vitro by solution - binding assays and by ligand blot assays .
This marked association is not seen with simple epithelial type II keratins , <prot>  vimentin </prot>  , or with type I keratins , providing a possible explanation for the greater stability of the epidermal keratin filament architecture over that of other cell types .
We have identified an 18 - amino acid residue stretch in the <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  K5 </prot>  </p1>  head that is conserved only among type II epidermal keratins and that appears to play some role in <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  DPI </prot>  </p2>  tail binding .
This finding might have important implications for understanding a recent point mutation found within this binding site in a family with a blistering skin disorder .

TI - A newly identified member of tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily ( <prot>  TR6 </prot>  ) suppresses <prot>  LIGHT </prot>  - mediated apoptosis .
PG - 13733 - 6 AB - <prot>  TR6 </prot>  ( <prot>  decoy receptor 3 </prot>  ( <prot>  DcR3 </prot>  ) ) is a new member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor ( TNFR ) family .
 <prot> TR6 </prot>  mRNA is expressed in lung tissues and colon adenocarcinoma , SW480 .
In addition , the expression of <prot>  TR6 </prot>  mRNA was shown in the endothelial cell line and induced by phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate / ionomycin in Jurkat T leukemia cells .
The open reading frame of <prot>  TR6 </prot>  encodes 300 amino acids with a 29 - residue signal sequence but no transmembrane region .
Using histidine - tagged recombinant <prot>  TR6 </prot>  , we screened soluble forms of TNF - ligand proteins with immunoprecipitation .
Here , we demonstrate that <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  TR6 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  specifically binds two cellular ligands , <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  LIGHT </prot>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  herpes virus entry mediator ( HVEM ) - L </prot>  </p2>  ) and <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  <prot>  Fas </prot>  ligand </prot>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  FasL </prot>  </p2>  / <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  CD95L </prot>  </p2>  ) .
These bindings were confirmed with HEK 293 EBNA cells transfected with <prot>  LIGHT </prot>  cDNA by flow cytometry .
 <prot> TR6 </prot>  inhibited <prot>  LIGHT </prot>  - induced cytotoxicity in HT29 cells .
It has been shown that <prot>  LIGHT </prot>  triggers apoptosis of various tumor cells including HT29 cells that express both <prot>  <p1  pair=9 >  <prot>  lymphotoxin beta </prot>  </p1>  receptor </prot>  ( <p2  pair=9 >  <prot>  LTbetaR </prot>  </p2>  ) and <prot>  HVEM </prot>  / <prot>  TR2 </prot>  receptors .
Our data suggest that <prot>  TR6 </prot>  inhibits the interactions of <p1  pair=6 >  <p1  pair=7 >  <p1  pair=8 >  <prot>  LIGHT </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  with <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  HVEM </prot>  </p2>  / <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  TR2 </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  LTbetaR </prot>  </p2>  , thereby suppressing <prot>  LIGHT </prot>  - mediated HT29 cell death .
Thus , <prot>  TR6 </prot>  may play a regulatory role for suppressing in <prot>  FasL </prot>  - and <prot>  LIGHT </prot>  - mediated cell death .

PG - 4467 - 71 AB - The <prot>  retinoblastoma protein </prot>  ( <prot>  Rb </prot>  ) is a target of viral oncoproteins .
To explore the hypothesis that viral proteins may be structural mimics of cellular proteins , we have searched cDNA libraries for <prot>  Rb </prot>  - binding proteins .
We report here the cloning of a cDNA for the protein <prot>  RIZ </prot>  from rat and human cells .
 <prot> RIZ </prot>  is a 250 - kDa nuclear protein containing eight zinc - finger motifs .
It contains an <prot>  Rb </prot>  - binding motif that shares an antigenic epitope with the C terminus of <prot>  E1A </prot>  .
A domain is conserved between <prot>  RIZ </prot>  and the <prot>  PRDI - BF1 </prot>  / <prot>  Blimp - 1 </prot>  differentiation factor .
Other motifs of <prot>  RIZ </prot>  include putative GTPase and SH3 ( src homology domain 3 ) domains .
 <prot> RIZ </prot>  is preferentially expressed in both adult and embryonic rat neuroendocrine tissues .
It is also expressed in human retinoblastoma cells and at low levels in all other human cell lines examined .
While the function of <prot>  RIZ </prot>  is not yet clear , its structure and pattern of expression suggest a role for <prot>  RIZ </prot>  in transcriptional regulation during neuronal differentiation and pathogenesis of retinoblastoma .

PG - 505 - 12 AB - Using the cytoplasmic domain of <prot>  Fas </prot>  in the yeast two - hybrid system , we have identified a novel interacting protein , <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  FADD </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  , which binds <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  Fas </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  Fas </prot>  </p2>  - <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  FD5 </prot>  </p2>  , a mutant of <prot>  Fas </prot>  possessing enhanced killing activity , but not the functionally inactive mutants <prot>  Fas </prot>  - <prot>  LPR </prot>  and <prot>  Fas </prot>  - <prot>  FD8 </prot>  .
 <prot> FADD </prot>  contains a death domain homologous to the death domains of <prot>  Fas </prot>  and <prot>  TNFR - 1 </prot>  .
A point mutation in <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  FADD </prot>  </p1>  , analogous to the lpr mutation of <prot>  Fas </prot>  , abolishes its ability to bind <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  Fas </prot>  </p2>  , suggesting a death domain to death domain interaction .
Overexpression of <prot>  FADD </prot>  in MCF7 and BJAB cells induces apoptosis , which , like <prot>  Fas </prot>  - induced apoptosis , is blocked by <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  CrmA </prot>  </p1>  , a specific inhibitor of the <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  <prot>  interleukin - 1 beta </prot>  - converting enzyme </prot>  </p2>  .
These findings suggest that <prot>  FADD </prot>  may play an important role in the proximal signal transduction of <prot>  Fas </prot>  .

PG - 513 - 23 AB - Ligation of the extracellular domain of the cell surface receptor <prot>  Fas </prot>  / <prot>  APO - 1 </prot>  ( <prot>  CD95 </prot>  ) elicits a characteristic programmed death response in susceptible cells .
Using a genetic selection based on protein - protein interaction in yeast , we have identified two gene products that associate with the intracellular domain of <p1  pair=4 >  <p1  pair=5 >  <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  Fas </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  : <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  Fas </prot>  </p2>  itself , and a novel 74 kDa protein we have named <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  RIP </prot>  </p2>  , for <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  receptor interacting protein </prot>  </p2>  .
 <p1  pair=7 >  <prot> RIP </prot>  </p1>  also interacts weakly with the <prot>  p55 </prot>  tumor necrosis factor receptor ( <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  TNFR1 </prot>  </p2>  ) intracellular domain , but not with a mutant version of <prot>  Fas </prot>  corresponding to the murine lprcg mutation .
 <prot> RIP </prot>  contains an N - terminal region with homology to protein kinases and a C - terminal region containing a cytoplasmic motif ( death domain ) present in the <prot>  Fas </prot>  and <prot>  TNFR1 </prot>  intracellular domains .
Transient overexpression of <prot>  RIP </prot>  causes transfected cells to undergo the morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis .
Taken together , these properties indicate that <prot>  RIP </prot>  is a novel form of apoptosis - inducing protein .

Previously , a mammalian protein that directly associates with <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  FKBP12 </prot>  </p1>  - rapamycin has been identified and its encoding gene has been cloned from both human ( designated <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  FRAP </prot>  </p2>  ) [ Brown , E.J. , Albers , M.W. , Shin , T.B. , Ichikawa , K. , Keith , C.T. , Lane , W.S.

The full - length <prot>  FRAP </prot>  is a 289 - kDa protein containing a putative phosphatidylinositol kinase domain .
Using an in vitro transcription / translation assay method coupled with proteolysis studies , we have identified an 11 - kDa <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  FKBP12 </prot>  </p1>  - rapamycin - binding domain within <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  FRAP </prot>  </p2>  .
This minimal binding domain lies N - terminal to the kinase domain and spans residues 2025 - 2114 .
In addition , we have carried out mutagenesis studies to investigate the role of Ser2035 , a potential phosphorylation site for <prot>  protein kinase C </prot>  within this domain .
We now show that the <prot>  FRAP </prot>  Ser2035 -- GTTTTT Ala mutant displays similar binding affinity when compared with the wild - type protein , whereas all other mutations at this site , including mimics of phosphoserine , abolish binding , presumably due to either unfavorable steric interactions or induced conformational changes .

TI - Localization of functional receptor epitopes on the structure of ciliary neurotrophic factor indicates a conserved , function - related epitope topography among helical cytokines .
PG - 14007 - 14 AB - By rational mutagenesis , receptor - specific functional analysis , and visualization of complex formation in solution , we identified individual amino acid side chains involved specifically in the interaction of <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  ciliary neurotrophic factor </prot>  </p1>  ( <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  CNTF </prot>  </p1>  ) with <p2  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  CNTFR alpha </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  and not with the beta - components , <prot>  gp130 </prot>  and <prot>  LIFR </prot>  .
In the crystal structure , the side chains of these residues , which are located in helix A , the AB loop , helix B , and helix D , are surface accessible and are clustered in space , thus constituting an epitope for <prot>  CNTFR alpha </prot>  .
By the same analysis , a partial epitope for <prot>  gp130 </prot>  was also identified on the surface of helix A that faces away from the alpha - epitope .
Superposition of the <prot>  CNTF </prot>  and growth hormone structures showed that the location of these epitopes on <prot>  CNTF </prot>  is analogous to the location of the first and second receptor epitopes on the surface of growth hormone .
Further comparison with proposed binding sites for alpha - and beta - receptors on <prot>  interleukin - 6 </prot>  and leukemia inhibitory factor indicated that this epitope topology is conserved among helical cytokines .
In each case , epitope I is utilized by the specificity - conferring component , whereas epitopes II and III are used by accessory components .
Thus , in addition to a common fold , helical cytokines share a conserved order of receptor epitopes that is function related .

We propose that ( i ) the <p1  pair=22 >  <p1  pair=23 >  <prot>  IGF - IR </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  and the <p1  pair=24 >  <p1  pair=25 >  <prot>  IR </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  share at least in part the same molecular mechanism underlying their interplay with their two substrates , <p2  pair=22 >  <p2  pair=24 >  <prot>  p52Shc </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=23 >  <p2  pair=25 >  <prot>  IRS - 1 </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  , and ( ii ) <p1  pair=26 >  <prot>  IRS - 1 </prot>  </p1>  interacts with the <p1  pair=27 >  <p2  pair=26 >  <prot>  IGF - IR </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  in a fashion that is different from that used by <p2  pair=27 >  <prot>  p52Shc </prot>  </p2>  .
Finally , our data highlight the crucial role of the juxtamembrane domain in signaling by both the <prot>  IR </prot>  and the <prot>  IGF - IR </prot>  .

PG - 5725 - 31 AB - In the second of a series of experiments designed to identify <prot>  p47nck </prot>  - Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) - binding molecules , we report the cloning of <prot>  SAKAP II </prot>  ( <prot>  Src A box Nck - associated protein II </prot>  ) from an HL60 cDNA expression library .
This molecule has been identified as a cDNA encoding the protein product of <prot>  WASP </prot>  , which is mutated in Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome patients .
Studies in vivo and in vitro demonstrated a highly specific interaction between the SH3 domains of <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  p47nck </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein </prot>  </p2>  .
Furthermore , anti - <prot>  Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein </prot>  antibodies recognized a protein of 66 kDa by Western blot ( immunoblot ) analysis .
In vitro translation studies identified the 66 - kDa protein as the protein product of <prot>  WASP </prot>  , and subcellular fractionation experiments showed that <prot>  p66WASP </prot>  is mainly present in the cytosol fraction , although significant amounts are also present in membrane and nuclear fractions .
The main <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  p47nck </prot>  </p1>  region implicated in the association with <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  p66WASP </prot>  </p2>  was found to be the carboxy - terminal SH3 domain .

TI - Correlation of two - hybrid affinity data with in vitro measurements .
PG - 5820 - 9 AB - Since their introduction , the interaction trap and other two - hybrid systems have been used to study protein - protein interactions .
Despite their general use , little is known about the extent to which the degree of protein interaction determined by two - hybrid approaches parallels the degree of interaction determined by biochemical techniques .
In this study , we used a set of lexAop - LEU2 and lexAop - lacZ reporters to calibrate the interaction trap .
For the calibration , we used two sets of proteins , the <prot>  Myc </prot>  - <prot>  Max </prot>  - <prot>  Mxi1 </prot>  helix - loop - helix proteins , and wild - type and dimerization - defective versions of the lambda cI repressor .
Our results indicate that the strength of interaction as predicted by the two - hybrid approach generally correlates with that determined in vitro , permitting discrimination of high - , intermediate - , and low - affinity interactions , but there was no single reporter for which the amount of gene expression linearly reflected affinity measured in vitro .
However , some reporters showed thresholds and only responded to stronger interactions .
Finally , some interactions were subject to directionality , and their apparent strength depended on the reporter used .
Taken together , our results provide a cautionary framework for interpreting affinities from two - hybrid experiments .

TI - Interaction of <prot>  p85 </prot>  subunit of <prot>  PI 3 - kinase </prot>  with <prot>  insulin </prot>  and <prot>  IGF - 1 </prot>  receptors analysed by using the two - hybrid system .
PG - 51 - 5 AB - Interaction of the <prot>  p85 </prot>  subunit of <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  PI 3 - kinase </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  with the <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  <prot>  insulin </prot>  receptor </prot>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  IR </prot>  </p2>  ) and the <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  <prot>  IGF - 1 </prot>  receptor </prot>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  IGF - 1R </prot>  </p2>  ) was investigated using the two - hybrid system by assessing for his3 and lacZ activation in S. cerevisiae .
The experiments were performed with the cytoplasmic beta domain ( wild type or mutated ) of <prot>  IR </prot>  and <prot>  IGF - 1R </prot>  and <prot>  p85 </prot>  or its subdomains ( N + C - SH2 , N - SH2 , C - SH2 , SH3 + N - SH2 ) .
The results of his3 activation indicated that <p1  pair=5 >  <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  p85 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  , N + C - SH2 and C - SH2 interact with both <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  <prot>  IR </prot>  beta </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  <prot>  IGF - 1R </prot>  beta </prot>  </p2>  , whereas N - SH2 and SH3 + N - SH2 interact only with <prot>  <prot>  IR </prot>  beta </prot>  .
Interaction of <p1  pair=7 >  <p1  pair=8 >  <prot>  p85 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  and N+C - SH2 with <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  IR beta </prot>  </p2>  ( <prot>  delta C - 43 </prot>  ) or <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  <prot>  IGF - 1R </prot>  beta </prot>  </p2>  ( <prot>  delta C - 43 </prot>  ) in which the C - terminal 43 amino acids ( including the YXXM motif ) were deleted , persisted .
The internal binding site thus revealed was not altered by further mutating Y960 / F for <prot>  IR </prot>  or Y950 / F for <prot>  IGF - 1R </prot>  .
Activation of lacZ upon interaction of <p1  pair=10 >  <p1  pair=9 >  <prot>  p85 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  with <p2  pair=9 >  <prot>  IR beta </prot>  </p2>  ( <prot>  delta C - 43 </prot>  ) was 4 - fold less as compared to <p2  pair=10 >  <prot>  IR beta </prot>  </p2>  .
This activation with <p1  pair=11 >  <p1  pair=12 >  <p1  pair=13 >  <prot>  p85 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=11 >  <prot>  <prot>  IGF - 1R </prot>  beta </prot>  </p2>  was 4 - fold less as compared to <p2  pair=12 >  <prot>  IR beta </prot>  </p2>  and was somewhat increased ( 2 - fold ) for <p2  pair=13 >  <prot>  <prot>  IGF - 1R </prot>  beta </prot>  </p2>  ( <prot>  delta C - 4 </prot>  3 ) .
Thus , the C - terminal domain in <p1  pair=14 >  <prot>  IGF - 1R </prot>  </p1>  appears to exert a negative control on binding of <p2  pair=14 >  <prot>  p85 </prot>  </p2>  thereby providing a possible regulatory mechanism for direct activation of the <prot>  PI 3 - kinase </prot>  pathway .

PG - 155 - 8 AB - The heterotrimeric G protein , <prot>  G alpha i2 </prot>  , transduces signals from seven membrane spanning receptors to effectors such as adenylyl cyclase and ion channels .
The purpose of this study was to identify these or other cellular proteins that interact with <prot>  G alpha i2 </prot>  by use of the yeast two - hybrid system .
A human B cell cDNA library was screened by this system using full length <prot>  G alpha i2 </prot>  .
Four positive colonies were obtained .
Two of the four were identified as <prot>  nucleobindin </prot>  , a calcium binding protein and a putative antigen to which anti - nuclear antibodies are generated in mice with a disorder that resembles systemic lupus erythematosus .
 <prot> Nucleobindin </prot>  has a leucine zipper , EF hands , and a signal peptide sequence and is thought to localize to the nucleus as well as being secreted .
The specificity of intehraction between <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  G alpha i2 </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  nucleobindin </prot>  </p2>  was confirmed by an in vitro binding assay using recombinant proteins .
Transfection of <prot>  G alpha i2 </prot>  and <prot>  nucleobindin </prot>  in COS cells increased <prot>  G alpha i2 </prot>  expression relative to cells transfected with <prot>  G alpha i2 </prot>  and mock vector .
Our results indicate that the yeast two - hybrid system provides a means to identify novel proteins that interact with G alpha proteins .
 <prot> Nucleobindin </prot>  appears to represent one of those proteins .

PG - 26602 - 6 AB - We have previously shown that soluble partially degraded fibrin ( ogen ) remains in solution after fibrin clot formation and is a potent fibroblast mitogen ( Gray , A.J. , Bishop , J.E. , Reeves J.T. , Mecham , R.P. , and Laurent , G.J. ( 1995 ) Am. J. Cell Mol. Biol. 12 , 684 - 690 ) .
Mitogenic sites within the fibrin ( ogen ) molecule are located on the A alpha and B beta chains of the protein ( Gray , A.J. , Bishop , J. E. , Reeves , J.T. , and Laurent , G.J. ( 1993 ) J. Cell Sci. 104 , 409 - 413 ) .
However , receptor pathways through which mitogenic effects are mediated are unknown .
The present study sought to determine the nature of fibrin ( ogen ) receptors expressed on human fibroblasts which interact with the <prot>  fibrinogen B beta chain </prot>  .
Receptor complexes were isolated from 125I - surface - labeled fibroblasts and purified on a <prot>  fibrinogen B beta chain </prot>  affinity column .
Subsequent high performance liquid chromatography and SDS - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis indicated <prot>  fibrinogen B beta chain </prot>  bound specifically to a 60 - kDa surface protein .
Sequence analysis of the amino terminus of this protein indicated 100 % homology to human <prot>  calreticulin </prot>  .
Immunoprecipitation experiments employing a polyclonal anti - <prot>  calreticulin </prot>  antibody provided further evidence that the 60 - kDa protein isolated in this study was <prot>  calreticulin </prot>  .
Further , polyclonal antibodies to human <prot>  calreticulin </prot>  significantly inhibited the mitogenic activity of <prot>  fibrinogen B beta chain </prot>  on human fibroblasts .
The present study has shown that cell surface <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  calreticulin </prot>  </p1>  binds to the <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  B beta chain of fibrinogen </prot>  </p2>  mediating its mitogenic activity .

Transcriptional synergy with <prot>  NF - IL6 beta </prot>  ( C / <prot>  EBP delta </prot>  , <prot>  CRP3 </prot>  ) .
PG - 4330 - 8 AB - <prot>  PU.1 </prot>  is a transcription factor that belongs to the ets family of DNA binding proteins .
In this study , we show by Far Western blot analyses that multiple nuclear proteins are capable of physically interacting with <prot>  PU.1 </prot>  .
Using radiolabeled <prot>  PU.1 </prot>  protein as a probe , we screened a B cell cDNA expression library and isolated a number of clones encoding <prot>  PU.1 </prot>  interacting proteins .
Three of these clones encode DNA binding proteins ( <prot>  NF - IL6 beta </prot>  , <prot>  HMG I / Y </prot>  , and <prot>  SSRP </prot>  ) , one clone encodes a chaperone protein , and another clone encodes a multifunctional phosphatase .
We have characterized the physical and functional interactions between <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  PU.1 </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  NF - IL6 beta </prot>  </p2>  , a leucine zipper transcription factor implicated in inflammatory responses .
We found that deletion of the carboxyl - terminal 28 amino acids of <prot>  PU.1 </prot>  disrupted <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  PU.1 </prot>  </p1>  - <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  NF - IL6 beta </prot>  </p2>  physical interaction .
This deletion disrupts the <prot>  PU.1 </prot>  Ets domain .
Deletion of the <prot>  NF - IL6 beta </prot>  leucine zipper domain also greatly diminished the interaction between these two proteins .
In transient expression assays , we found that <prot>  PU.1 </prot>  and <prot>  NF - IL6 beta </prot>  can functionally cooperate to synergistically activate transcription .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that <prot>  PU.1 </prot>  and <prot>  NF - IL6 beta </prot>  can simultaneously bind to adjacent DNA binding sites , but apparently do not influence the kinetics or affinity of each other 's DNA binding .
These results suggest that transcriptional synergy is due to each protein independently influencing the basal transcription complex .

TI - Molecular cloning and expression of the 32 - kDa subunit of human <prot>  TFIID </prot>  reveals interactions with <prot>  VP16 </prot>  and <prot>  TFIIB </prot>  that mediate transcriptional activation .
PG - 5788 - 92 AB - Transcription factor <prot>  TFIID </prot>  consists of <prot>  TATA binding protein </prot>  ( <prot>  TBP </prot>  ) and at least eight <prot>  TBP </prot>  - associated factors ( TAFs ) .
As TAFs are required for activated but not basal transcription , we have proposed that <prot>  TAF </prot>  s act as coactivators to mediate signals between activators and the basal transcription machinery .
Here we report the cloning , expression , and biochemical characterization of the 32 - kDa subunit of human ( h ) <prot>  TFIID </prot>  , termed <prot>  hTAFII32 </prot>  .
We find that <prot>  hTAFII32 </prot>  is the human homologue of Drosophila <prot>  TAFII40 </prot>  .
In vitro protein - protein interaction assays reveal that as observed with Drosophila <prot>  TAFII40 </prot>  , <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  hTAFII32 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  interacts with the C - terminal 39 - amino acid activation domain of the acidic transactivator <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  viral protein 16 </prot>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  VP16 </prot>  </p2>  ) as well as with the general transcription factor <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  TFIIB </prot>  </p2>  .
Moreover , a partial recombinant <prot>  TFIID </prot>  complex containing <prot>  hTAFII32 </prot>  was capable of mediating in vitro transcriptional activation by the <prot>  VP16 </prot>  activation domain .
These findings indicate that specific activator - coactivator interactions have been conserved between human and Drosophila and provide additional support for the function of these interactions in mediating transcriptional activation .

TI - A potential interaction of <prot>  p75 </prot>  and <prot>  trkA </prot>  <prot>  NGF </prot>  receptors revealed by affinity crosslinking and immunoprecipitation .
PG - 557 - 63 AB - <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  Nerve growth factor </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  binds independently to two transmembrane receptors , the <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  <prot>  p75 </prot>  neurotrophin receptor </prot>  </p2>  and the <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  <prot>  p140trk </prot>  ( <prot>  trkA </prot>  ) tyrosine kinase receptor </prot>  </p2>  , which are both co - expressed in the majority of neuronal cells that respond to <prot>  NGF </prot>  .
Previous findings have suggested that appropriate co - expression of the two receptors gives rise to high affinity <prot>  NGF </prot>  binding sites and increased neurotrophin responsiveness ; however , evidence demonstrating a direct interaction between the two receptors in cell lines has been lacking .
Here we have utilized affinity crosslinking agents with 125I - NGF to detect an association of <prot>  trkA </prot>  and <prot>  p75 </prot>  receptors in embryonic spinal cord and brain tissues enriched in the two receptors .
Although multimeric complexes of <prot>  trkA </prot>  and <prot>  p75 </prot>  were not detected by affinity crosslinking , immunoprecipitation of cross - linked <prot>  <prot>  NGF </prot>  - receptor </prot>  complexes with <prot>  trk </prot>  - specific antibodies resulted in selective immunoprecipitation of crosslinked <prot>  p75 </prot>  .
Our results indicate that the <prot>  trkA </prot>  and <prot>  p75 </prot>  receptors can potentially interact , and that such an association may be responsible for the generation of high affinity <prot>  NGF </prot>  binding sites .

We have isolated a human cDNA encoding the first eosinophil - selective chemokine receptor , designated <prot>  CC chemokine receptor 3 </prot>  ( <prot>  CC CKR3 </prot>  ) .
 <prot> CC CKR3 </prot>  is a seven - transmembrane domain G protein - coupled receptor most closely related to the previously reported monocyte - and neutrophil - selective receptor <prot>  CC CKR1 </prot>  ( also known as the <prot>  MIP - 1 alpha </prot>  / <prot>  RANTES </prot>  receptor ) .
When [ Ca2+ ] i changes were monitored in stably transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells , <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  ( MIP ) - 1 alpha </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  <prot>  MIP </prot>  and <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  RANTES </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  were both potent agonists for <p2  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  CC CKR3 </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=3 >  <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  CC CKR1 </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  .
However , <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  MIP - 1 beta </prot>  </p1>  was also an agonist for <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  CC CKR3 </prot>  </p2>  but not <prot>  CC CKR1 </prot>  ; <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  MCP - 3 </prot>  </p1>  was an agonist for <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  CC CKR1 </prot>  </p2>  but not <prot>  CC CKR3 </prot>  .

TI - Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase <prot>  PTPmu </prot>  associates with cadherins and catenins in vivo .
PG - 977 - 86 AB - The extracellular segment of the receptor - type type protein tyrosine phosphatase <prot>  PTPmu </prot>  , possesses an MAM domain , an immunoglobulin domain , and four fibronectin type - III repeats .
It binds homophilically , i.e. , <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  PTPmu </prot>  </p1>  on the surface of one cell binds to <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  PTPmu </prot>  </p2>  on an apposing cell , and the binding site lies within the immunoglobulin domain .
The intracellular segment of <prot>  PTPmu </prot>  has two PTP domains and a juxtamembrane segment that is homologous to the conserved intracellular domain of the cadherins .
In cadherins , this segment interacts with proteins termed catenins to mediate association with the actin cytoskeleton .
In this article , we demonstrate that <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  PTPmu </prot>  </p1>  associates with a complex containing <prot>  cadherins , alpha </prot>  - and <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  beta - catenin </prot>  </p2>  in mink lung ( MvLu ) cells , and in rat heart , lung , and brain tissues .
Greater than 80 % of the cadherin in the cell is cleared from Triton X - 100 lysates of MvLu cells after immunoprecipitation with antibodies to <prot>  PTPmu </prot>  ; however , the complex is dissociated when lysates are prepared in more stringent , SDS - containing RIPA buffer .
In vitro binding studies demonstrated that the intracellular segment of <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  PTPmu </prot>  </p1>  binds directly to the intracellular domain of <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  E - cadherin </prot>  </p2>  , but not to alpha - or <prot>  beta - catenin </prot>  .
Consistent with their ability to interact in vivo , <prot>  PTPmu </prot>  , cadherins , and catenins all localized to points of cell - cell contact in MvLu cells , as assessed by immunocytochemical staining .
After pervanadate treatment of MvLu cells , which inhibits cellular tyrosine phosphatase activity including <prot>  PTPmu </prot>  , the cadherins associated with <prot>  PTPm u </prot>  are now found in a tyrosine - phosphorylated form , indicating that the cadherins may be an endogenous substrate for <prot>  PTPmu </prot>  .
These data suggest that <prot>  PTPmu </prot>  may be one of the enzymes that regulates the dynamic tyrosine phosphorylation , and thus function , of the cadherin / catenin complex in vivo .

TI - Cloning and characterization of a human type II receptor for bone morphogenetic proteins .
PG - 7632 - 6 AB - Bone morphogenetic proteins ( BMPs ) are members of the <prot>  transforming growth factor beta </prot>  superfamily .
Several members of this family have been shown to transduce their signals through binding to type I and type II serine - ( threonine ) kinase receptors .
Here we report the cDNA cloning and characterization of a human type II receptor for BMPs ( <prot>  BMPR - II </prot>  ) , which is distantly related to <prot>  DAF - 4 </prot>  , a <prot>  BMP type II receptor </prot>  from Caenorhabditis elegans .

PG - 7892 - 6 AB - The <prot>  cdc25 </prot>  phosphatases play key roles in cell cycle progression by activating cyclin - dependent kinases .
Two members of the 14 - 3 - 3 protein family have been isolated in a yeast two - hybrid screen designed to identify proteins that interact with the human cdc25A and cdc25B phosphatases .
Genes encoding the human homolog of the 14 - 3 - 3 epsilon protein and the previously described 14 - 3 - 3 beta protein have been isolated in this screening .
14 - 3 - 3 proteins constitute a family of well - conserved eukaryotic proteins that were originally isolated in mammalian brain preparations and that possess diverse biochemical activities related to signal transduction .
We present evidence that indicates that <prot>  cdc25 </prot>  and 14 - 3 - 3 proteins physically interact both in vitro and in vivo .
14 - 3 - 3 protein does not , however , affect the phosphatase activity of cdc25A .
 <p1  pair=1 >  <prot> Raf - 1 </prot>  </p1>  , which is known to bind 14 - 3 - 3 proteins , has recently been shown to associate with <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  cdc25A </prot>  </p2>  and to stimulate its phosphatase activity .
14 - 3 - 3 protein , however , has no effect on the <prot>  cdc25A </prot>  - kinase activity of <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  .
Instead , 14 - 3 - 3 may facilitate the association of <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  cdc25 </prot>  </p1>  with <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  </p2>  in vivo , participating in the linkage between mitogenic signaling and the cell cycle machinery .

TI - Cloning and expression of human <prot>  TAFII250 </prot>  : a TBP - associated factor implicated in cell - cycle regulation .
PG - 175 - 9 AB - Basal transcription by human RNA polymerase II requires the coordinate action of several ancillary factors ( <prot>  TFIIA - J </prot>  ) and can be regulated by various promoter - specific DNA binding proteins .
An additional class of factors , called coactivators , are dispensable for basal transcription but are indispensable for regulation by transcriptional activators .
Biochemical studies established that some coactivators are associated with the <prot>  TATA - binding protein </prot>  ( <prot>  TBP </prot>  ) to form the <prot>  TFIID </prot>  complex .
We therefore set out to define the relationship between <prot>  TBP </prot>  and these TBP - associated factors ( TAFs ) .
Here we describe the cloning , expression and properties of the first human TAF , <prot>  hTAFII250 </prot>  .
The <prot>  hTAFII250 </prot>  gene is identical to a gene , <prot>  CCG1 </prot>  , ( ref 7 , 8 ) , implicated in cell - cycle progression .
Recombinant <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  hTAFII250 </prot>  </p1>  binds directly to <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  TBP </prot>  </p2>  both in vitro and in yeast , and participates in the formation of the <prot>  TFIID </prot>  complex .
This largest TAF may therefore play a central role in <prot>  TFIID </prot>  assembly by interacting with both <prot>  TBP </prot>  and other TAFs , as well as serving to link the control of transcription to the cell cycle .

PG - 37 - 48 AB - <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  Fos </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  Jun </prot>  </p2>  oncoproteins form a complex that regulates transcription from promoters containing AP - 1 binding sites .
These two proteins , like other transcriptional activators , are likely to stimulate transcription through direct and / or indirect interactions with members of the basal transcriptional machinery .
The ability of <p1  pair=4 >  <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  c - Fos </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  and <p1  pair=6 >  <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  c - Jun </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  proteins to interact directly with the <p2  pair=4 >  <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  TATA box - binding protein </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=5 >  <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  TBP </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  ) , the general transcription factor required for initiating the assembly of transcription complexes , was investigated .
Using co - immunoprecipitation and protein - protein association assays , we show that both <p1  pair=8 >  <prot>  c - Fos </prot>  </p1>  and <p1  pair=9 >  <prot>  c - Jun </prot>  </p1>  bind specifically and stably to <p2  pair=8 >  <p2  pair=9 >  <prot>  TBP </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  Mutational analysis demonstrates that both the basic region and leucine zipper domains of <p1  pair=10 >  <prot>  c - Fos </prot>  </p1>  and <p1  pair=11 >  <prot>  c - Jun </prot>  </p1>  are necessary and sufficient for stable association with <p2  pair=10 >  <p2  pair=11 >  <prot>  TBP </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  .

We propose that <p1  pair=15 >  <prot>  c - Fos </prot>  </p1>  and <p1  pair=16 >  <prot>  c - Jun </prot>  </p1>  proteins function as transcriptional activators , in part by recruiting <p2  pair=15 >  <p2  pair=16 >  <prot>  TBP </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  to form complexes to initiate RNA synthesis .

PG - 3115 - 9 AB - <prot>  RB </prot>  , the protein product of the <prot>  retinoblastoma </prot>  tumor - suppressor gene , regulates the activity of specific transcription factors .
This regulation appears to be mediated either directly through interactions with specific transcription factors or through an alternative mechanism .
Here we report that stimulation of <prot>  Sp1 </prot>  - mediated transcription by <prot>  RB </prot>  is partially abrogated at the nonpermissive temperature in ts13 cells .
These cells contain a temperature - sensitive mutation in the <prot>  <prot>  TATA - binding protein </prot>  - associated factor </prot>  <prot>  TAFII250 </prot>  , first identified as the cell cycle regulatory protein <prot>  CCG1 </prot>  .
The stimulation of <prot>  Sp1 </prot>  - mediated transcription by <prot>  RB </prot>  in ts13 cells at the nonpermissive temperature could be restored by the introduction of wild - type human <prot>  TAFII250 </prot>  .

In contrast to <prot>  hTAFII28 </prot>  , <prot>  hTAFII18 </prot>  is a <prot>  <prot>  TFIID </prot>  beta </prot>  - specific <prot>  hTAFII </prot>  . <prot>  hTAFII20 </prot>  is the homologue of <prot>  p22 </prot>  , an alternatively spliced form of d <prot>  TAFII30 alpha </prot>  ( <prot>  p32 </prot>  ) .
Using a combination of protein affinity chromatography and cotransfection and immunoprecipitation assays , we have identified a series of in vitro and intracellular interactions among the novel hTAFIIs and between the novel hTAFIIs and <prot>  hTAFII30 </prot>  or TBP .
We show that <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  hTAFII28 </prot>  </p1>  interacts with <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  hTAFII18 </prot>  </p2>  both in vitro and intracellularly ; in contrast to its Drosophila homologue , <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  hTAFII28 </prot>  </p1>  also interacts directly with <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  TBP </prot>  </p2>  .
Deletion analysis indicates that <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  TBP </prot>  </p1>  and <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  hTAFII18 </prot>  </p1>  bind to distinct domains of <p2  pair=6 >  <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  hTAFII28 </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  . <p1  pair=10 >  <p1  pair=8 >  <p1  pair=9 >  <prot>  hTAFII18 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  also interacts with <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  TBP </prot>  </p2>  , but it interacts more strongly with <p2  pair=9 >  <prot>  hTAFII28 </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=10 >  <prot>  hTAFII30 </prot>  </p2>  .
The binding of <p1  pair=11 >  <prot>  hTAFII28 </prot>  </p1>  and <p1  pair=12 >  <prot>  hTAFII30 </prot>  </p1>  requires distinct domains of <p2  pair=11 >  <p2  pair=12 >  <prot>  hTAFII18 </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  .
As observed with the homologous Drosophila proteins , <p1  pair=13 >  <prot>  hTAFII20 </prot>  </p1>  interacts directly with <p2  pair=13 >  <prot>  TBP </prot>  </p2>  ; however , additional interactions between <p1  pair=14 >  <p1  pair=15 >  <prot>  hTAFII20 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=14 >  <prot>  hTAFII28 </prot>  </p2>  or <p2  pair=15 >  <prot>  hTAFII30 </prot>  </p2>  were detected .

PG - 2536 - 46 AB - The mammalian transcription factor <prot>  E2F </prot>  plays an important role in regulating the expression of genes that are required for passage through the cell cycle .
This transcriptional activity is inhibited by association with the <prot>  retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein </prot>  ( <prot>  pRB </prot>  ) or its relatives <prot>  p107 </prot>  and <prot>  p103 </prot>  .
The first cDNA from the <prot>  E2F </prot>  family to be cloned was designated <prot>  E2F - 1 </prot>  , and multiple <prot>  E2F </prot>  family members have now been identified .
They bind to DNA as heterodimers , interacting with proteins known as DP .
Here we demonstrate that DP is also a family of polypeptides with at least two members ( <prot>  hDP - 1 </prot>  and <prot>  hDP - 2 </prot>  ) .
Both <prot>  hDP - 1 </prot>  and <prot>  hDP - 2 </prot>  bind to all <prot>  E2F </prot>  family members in vivo , and each complex is capable of activating transcription .
However , the various <prot>  E2F </prot>  / DP complexes display strong differences in the ability to bind to either <prot>  pRB </prot>  or <prot>  p107 </prot>  in vivo , and the specificity of <prot>  pRB </prot>  or <prot>  p107 </prot>  binding is mediated by the <prot>  E2F </prot>  subunit .

PG - 1942 - 51 AB - The helical cytokine <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  interleukin ( IL ) 6 </prot>  </p1>  and its specific binding subunit <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  IL - 6R alpha </prot>  </p2>  form a 1:1 complex which , by promoting homodimerization of the signalling subunit <p1  pair=4 >  <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  gp130 </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  on the surface of target cells , triggers intracellular responses .
We expressed differently tagged forms of <prot>  gp130 </prot>  and used them in solution - phase binding assays to show that the soluble extracellular domains of <p1  pair=5 >  <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  gp130 </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  undergo dimerization in the absence of membranes .
In vitro receptor assembly reactions were also performed in the presence of two sets of <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  variants carrying amino acid substitutions in two distinct areas of the cytokine surface ( site 2 , comprising exposed residues in the A and C helices , and site 3 , in the terminal part of the CD loop ) .
The binding affinity to <prot>  IL - 6R alpha </prot>  of these variants is normal but their biological activity is poor or absent .
We demonstrate here that both the site 2 and site 3 <p1  pair=6 >  <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  variants complexed with <p1  pair=8 >  <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  IL - 6R alpha </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  bind a single <p2  pair=7 >  <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  gp130 </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  molecule but are unable to dimerize it , whereas the combined site 2 / 3 variants lose the ability to interact with <prot>  gp130 </prot>  .
The binding properties of these variants in vitro , and the result of using a neutralizing monoclonal antibody directed against site 3 , lead to the conclusion that <p1  pair=9 >  <p2  pair=9 >  <prot>  gp130 </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  dimer is formed through direct binding at two independent and differently oriented sites on <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  .
Immunoprecipitation experiments further reveal that the fully assembled receptor complex is composed of two <p1  pair=10 >  <p1  pair=11 >  <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  , two <p1  pair=12 >  <p2  pair=10 >  <prot>  IL - 6R alpha </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  and two <p2  pair=11 >  <p2  pair=12 >  <prot>  gp130 </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  molecules .
We propose here a model representing the <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  receptor complex as hexameric , which might be common to other helical cytokines .

PG - 14251 - 4 AB - <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  is a serine / threonine protein kinase positioned downstream of <prot>  Ras </prot>  in the <prot>  mitogen - activated protein kinase </prot>  cascade .
Using a yeast two - hybrid strategy to identify other proteins that interact with and potentially regulate <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  </p1>  , we isolated a clone encoding the carboxyl - terminal half of the <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  G beta 2 subunit </prot>  </p2>  of heterotrimeric G - proteins .
In vitro , purified <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=8 >  <prot>  G beta gamma </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  subunits specifically bound to a GST fusion protein encoding amino acids 1 - 330 of <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  Raf / 330 </prot>  </p2>  ) .
Binding assays with truncation mutants of GST - <prot>  Raf </prot>  indicate that the region located between amino acids 136 and 239 is a primary determinant for interaction with <prot>  G beta gamma </prot>  .
In competition experiments , the carboxyl terminus of <prot>  beta - adrenergic receptor kinase </prot>  ( <prot>  beta ARK </prot>  ) blocked the binding of <p1  pair=9 >  <prot>  G beta gamma </prot>  </p1>  to <p2  pair=9 >  <prot>  Raf / 330 </prot>  </p2>  ; however , the <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  </p1>  - binding proteins , <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  Ras </prot>  </p2>  and 14 - 3 - 3 , had no effect .
Scatchard analysis of in vitro binding between <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  Raf / 330 </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  G beta gamma </prot>  </p2>  revealed an affinity of interaction ( Kd = 163 + / - 36 nM ) , similar to that seen between <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  G beta gamma </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  beta ARK </prot>  </p2>  ( Kd = 87 + / - 24 nM ) .
The formation of native heterotrimeric <prot>  G alpha beta gamma </prot>  complexes , as measured by pertussis toxin ADP - ribosylation of G alpha , could be disrupted by increasing amounts of <prot>  Raf / 330 </prot>  , with an EC50 of approximately 200 nM , in close agreement with the estimated binding affinity .
In vivo complexes of <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  G beta gamma </prot>  </p2>  were isolated from human embryonic kidney 293 - T cells transfected with epitope - tagged <prot>  G beta 2 </prot>  .

The multisubunit <prot>  transcription factor IID </prot>  ( <prot>  TFIID </prot>  ) is thought to be a primary target for site - specific activators of transcription .

The carboxy - terminal regions form an asymmetric coiled - coil , and the amino - terminal regions make base - specific contacts with DNA in the major groove .
Comparison of the two crystallographically distinct protein - DNA complexes show that the coiled - coil is flexibly joined to the basic regions and that the <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  Fos </prot>  </p1>  - <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  Jun </prot>  </p2>  heterodimer does not recognize the asymmetric 5 ' - TGAGTCA - 3 ' recognition element in a unique orientation .
There is an extensive network of electrostatic interactions between subunits within the coiled - coil , consistent with proposals that these interactions determine preferential formation of the heterodimer over either of the homodimers .

TI - Cloning of an intrinsic human <prot>  TFIID </prot>  subunit that interacts with multiple transcriptional activators .
PG - 531 - 6 AB - <prot>  TFIID </prot>  is a multisubunit protein complex comprised of the <prot>  TATA - binding protein </prot>  ( <prot>  TBP </prot>  ) and multiple TBP - associated factors ( TAFs ) .
The TAFs in <prot>  TFIID </prot>  are essential for activator - dependent transcription .
The cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a human <prot>  TFIID </prot>  TAF , <prot>  TAFII55 </prot>  , that has no known homolog in Drosophila <prot>  TFIID </prot>  is now described .
 <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <p1  pair=5 >  <p1  pair=6 >  <prot> TAFII55 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  is shown to interact with the largest subunit ( <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  TAFII230 </prot>  </p2>  ) of human <prot>  TFIID </prot>  through its central region and with multiple activators -- including <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  Sp1 </prot>  </p2>  , <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  YY1 </prot>  </p2>  , <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  USF </prot>  </p2>  , <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  CTF </prot>  </p2>  , adenoviral <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  E1A </prot>  </p2>  , and human immunodeficiency virus - type 1 <prot>  Tat </prot>  proteins -- through a distinct amino - terminal domain .
The <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  TAFII55 </prot>  </p1>  - interacting region of <p1  pair=8 >  <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  Sp1 </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  was localized to its DNA - binding domain , which is distinct from the glutamine - rich activation domains previously shown to interact with Drosophila <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  TAFII110 </prot>  </p2>  .
Thus , this human <prot>  TFIID </prot>  TAF may be a co - activator that mediates a response to multiple activators through a distinct mechanism .

TI - Mutagenesis of the regulatory subunit ( <prot>  RII beta </prot>  ) of <prot>  cAMP - dependent protein kinase II beta </prot>  reveals hydrophobic amino acids that are essential for <p1  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  RII beta </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  dimerization and / or anchoring <prot>  RII beta </prot>  to the cytoskeleton .
PG - 1935 - 44 AB - In neurons <prot>  cAMP - dependent protein kinase II beta </prot>  ( <prot>  PKAII beta </prot>  ) is sequestered in the dendritic cytoskeleton because the regulatory subunit ( <prot>  RII beta </prot>  ) of the enzyme is tightly bound by A Kinase Anchor Proteins ( AKAPs ) .
The prototypic neuronal anchor protein <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  AKAP75 </prot>  </p1>  has a COOH - terminal 22 - residue <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  RII beta </prot>  </p2>  binding ( tethering ) site .
A key feature of the tethering site is that several amino acids with large aliphatic side chains mediate the high - affinity binding of <prot>  RII beta </prot>  .
Mutagenesis , recombinant protein expression , and physicochemical characterization were used to investigate the structural basis for the homodimerization and <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  AKAP75 </prot>  </p1>  binding activities of <p1  pair=3 >  <p2  pair=3 >  <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  RII beta </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  </p1>  .
Several crucial residues are located in an NH2 - terminal region that encompasses amino acids 13 - 36 .
Substitution of Ala for Leu13 or Phe36 generates monomeric <prot>  RII beta </prot>  subunits that cannot bind <prot>  AKAP75 </prot>  .
The results are not due to general misfolding since mutant <prot>  RII beta </prot>  monomers bind cAMP and inhibit the catalytic subunit of <prot>  PKAII beta </prot>  with the same affinity and efficacy as wild - type <p1  pair=5 >  <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  RII beta </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  dimers .
Moreover , substitution of Ala for Leu12 , Val20 , Leu21 , Phe31 , Leu33 , or Leu39 and replacement of Leu13 with Ile or Val did not impair the dimerization reaction .
Evidently , large hydrophobic side chains of Leu13 and Phe36 play pivotal roles in stabilizing <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  RII beta </prot>  </p1>  - <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  RII beta </prot>  </p2>  interactions .
A secondary consequence of destabilizing <p1  pair=7 >  <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  RII beta </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  dimers is the loss of intracellular targeting / anchoring capacity because monomers fail to bind <prot>  AKAP75 </prot>  .
Other NH2 - terminal residues directly modulate the affinity of <p1  pair=8 >  <p1  pair=9 >  <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  RII beta </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  </p1>  dimers for the <p2  pair=9 >  <prot>  AKAP75 </prot>  </p2>  tethering site .
Replacement of Val20 - Leu21 with Ala - Ala produced a dimeric <p1  pair=10 >  <prot>  RII beta </prot>  </p1>  protein that binds <p2  pair=10 >  <prot>  AKAP75 </prot>  </p2>  approximately 4 % as avidly as wild - type <prot>  RII beta </prot>  .
It is possible that the aliphatic side chains of Val20 and Leu21 interact with the essential Leu and Ile residues in the <prot>  AKAP75 </prot>  tethering region .

PG - 359 - 63 AB - The 72 - kDa spleen tyrosine kinase ( <prot>  Syk </prot>  ) and Src - family kinase <prot>  p53 </prot>  / <prot>  56Lyn </prot>  ( <prot>  Lyn </prot>  ) contribute to signaling via the B - cell antigen receptor complex .
Here we show that <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  Syk </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  Lyn </prot>  </p2>  from human B lymphocytes can interact directly .
 <p1  pair=5 >  <prot> Syk </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  Lyn </prot>  </p2>  coimmunoprecipitated from mature and activated B - cell lines , and gel - purified <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  Syk </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  Lyn </prot>  </p2>  reassociated in vitro , demonstrating their direct interaction .
This <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  Syk </prot>  </p1>  - <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  Lyn </prot>  </p2>  interaction may be dependent on the stage of B - cell differentiation , since <p1  pair=8 >  <prot>  Syk </prot>  </p1>  - <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  Lyn </prot>  </p2>  associations were not detected in pre - B and myeloma cell lines and <prot>  Syk </prot>  from an immature B - cell line did not reassociate with <prot>  Lyn </prot>  in vitro .
Serine / threonine kinase activity was also associated with <prot>  Syk </prot>  .
Crosslinking of cell surface IgM led to rapid activation of both tyrosine and serine / threonine protein kinase activities that resulted in phosphorylation in vitro of proteins coprecipitating with <prot>  Syk </prot>  -- in particular , a serine / threonine phosphorylated protein 120 kDa in size ( <prot>  pp120 </prot>  ) .
Several phosphoproteins , including one of 72 kDa and one of 120 kDa , coprecipitated with <prot>  phospholipase C - gamma 1 </prot>  ( <prot>  PLC gamma 1 </prot>  ) .
Sequential immunoprecipitation identified the 72 - kDa protein associated with <p1  pair=9 >  <prot>  PLC gamma 1 </prot>  </p1>  as <p2  pair=9 >  <prot>  Syk </prot>  </p2>  .
The 120 - kDa serine / threonine phosphorylated protein that coprecipitated with <prot>  PLC gamma 1 </prot>  resembled the <p1  pair=10 >  <prot>  Syk </prot>  </p1>  - associated <p2  pair=10 >  <prot>  pp120 </prot>  </p2>  by several criteria .
Thus , <p1  pair=12 >  <p1  pair=13 >  <prot>  pp120 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  may serve as a link between <p1  pair=11 >  <p2  pair=12 >  <prot>  Syk </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=11 >  <p2  pair=13 >  <prot>  PLC gamma 1 </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  , coupling the B - cell antigen receptor to the phosphatidylinositol pathway .

PG - 279 - 84 AB - Using a protein interaction cloning technique , we identified cDNAs that encode a novel <prot>  <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  </p1>  - binding protein </prot>  , termed <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  BAG - 1 </prot>  </p2>  .
The <prot>  BAG - 1 </prot>  protein shares no significant homology with <p1  pair=3 >  <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  or other <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  family proteins , which can form homo - and heterodimers .
In gene transfer experiments using a human lymphoid cell line , Jurkat , coexpression of <prot>  BAG - 1 </prot>  and <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  provided markedly increased protection from cell death induced by several stimuli , including staurosporine , anti - Fas antibody , and cytolytic T cells , relative to cells that contained gene transfer - mediated elevations in either <prot>  BAG - 1 </prot>  or <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  protein alone .
 <prot> BAG </prot>  - transfected 3T3 fibroblasts also exhibited prolonged cell survival in response to an apoptotic stimulus .
The findings indicate that bag - 1 represents a new type of anti - cell death gene and suggest that some routes of apoptosis induction previously ascribed to <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  - independent pathways may instead reflect a need for the combination of <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  and <prot>  BAG - 1 </prot>  .

TI - <prot>  Syntrophin </prot>  binds to an alternatively spliced exon of <prot>  dystrophin </prot>  .
PG - 363 - 71 AB - <prot>  Dystrophin </prot>  , the protein product of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy locus , is a protein of the membrane cytoskeleton that associates with a complex of integral and membrane - associated proteins .
Of these , the 58 - kD intracellular membrane - associated protein , syntrophin , was recently shown to consist of a family of three related but distinct genes .
We expressed the cDNA of human <prot>  beta 1 - syntrophin </prot>  and the COOH terminus of human <prot>  dystrophin </prot>  in reticulocyte lysates using an in vitro transcription / translation system .
Using antibodies to <prot>  dystrophin </prot>  we immunoprecipitated these two interacting proteins in a variety of salt and detergent conditions .
We demonstrate that the 53 amino acids encoded on exon 74 of <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  dystrophin </prot>  </p1>  , an alternatively spliced exon , are necessary and sufficient for interaction with translated <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  beta 1 - syntrophin </prot>  </p2>  in our assay .
On the basis of its alternative splicing , <prot>  dystrophin </prot>  may thus be present in two functionally distinct populations .
In this recombinant expression system , the <prot>  dystrophin </prot>  relatives , human <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  <prot>  dystrophin </prot>  related protein </prot>  </p1>  ( <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  DRP </prot>  </p1>  or <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  utrophin </prot>  </p1>  ) and the <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  87K postsynaptic protein </prot>  </p1>  from Torpedo electric organ , also bind to translated <p2  pair=2 >  <p2  pair=3 >  <p2  pair=4 >  <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  beta 1 - syntrophin </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  </p2>  </p2>  .
We have found a COOH - terminal 37 - kD fragment of <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  beta 1 - syntrophin </prot>  </p1>  sufficient to interact with translated <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  dystrophin </prot>  </p2>  and its homologues , suggesting that the <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  dystrophin </prot>  </p1>  binding site on <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  beta 1 - syntrophin </prot>  </p2>  occurs on a region that is conserved among the three syntrophin homologues .

TI - Interaction with <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  RAP74 </prot>  </p1>  subunit of <prot>  TFIIF </prot>  is required for transcriptional activation by <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  serum response factor </prot>  </p2>  .
PG - 632 - 5 AB - A few general transcription factors , in particular <prot>  TFIID </prot>  and <prot>  TFIIB </prot>  , have been found to bind transcriptional activators .
Here we show that the general transcription factor <prot>  TFIIF </prot>  is also a target for a transcriptional activator , namely <prot>  serum response factor </prot>  ( <prot>  SRF </prot>  ) , which binds to the <prot>  c - fos </prot>  promoter .
Using a yeast interaction assay , we find that <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  SRF </prot>  </p1>  binds the <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  RAP74 </prot>  </p2>  subunit of <prot>  TFIIF </prot>  and that <prot>  SRF </prot>  ' s transcriptional activation domain is the region involved in this binding .
Further , <prot>  RAP74 </prot>  ' s central charged cluster domain is required for binding to <prot>  SRF </prot>  ' s activation domain .
Deletion of this domain impairs <prot>  RAP74 </prot>  ' s ability to support <prot>  SRF </prot>  - activated transcription in vitro but has little effect on the protein 's basal transcription activity or its ability to support <prot>  SP1 </prot>  - activated transcription .
The correlation of <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  SRF </prot>  </p1>  - <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  RAP74 </prot>  </p2>  binding with transcriptional activation suggests that <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  RAP74 </prot>  </p1>  is a critical target for <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  SRF </prot>  </p2>  - activated transcription .

PG - 177 - 80 AB - The protein encoded by the <prot>  retinoblastoma susceptibility gene </prot>  ( <prot>  Rb </prot>  ) functions as a tumour suppressor and negative growth regulator .
As actively growing cells require the ongoing synthesis of ribosomal RNA , we considered that <prot>  Rb </prot>  might interact with the ribosomal DNA transcription apparatus .
Here we report that ( 1 ) there is an accumulation of <prot>  Rb </prot>  protein in the nucleoli of differentiated U937 cells which correlates with inhibition of rDNA transcription ; ( 2 ) addition of <prot>  Rb </prot>  to an in vitro transcription system inhibits transcription by RNA polymerase I ; ( 3 ) this inhibition requires a functional <prot>  Rb </prot>  pocket ; and ( 4 ) <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  Rb </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  specifically inhibits the activity of the RNA polymerase I transcription factor <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  UBF </prot>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  upstream binding factor </prot>  </p2>  ) in vitro .

These results indicate that there is an additional mechanism by which <prot>  Rb </prot>  suppresses cell growth , namely that <prot>  Rb </prot>  directly represses transcription of the rRNA genes .

TI - <prot>  Inhibin </prot>  antagonizes inhibition of liver cell growth by activin by a dominant - negative mechanism .
PG - 6308 - 13 AB - The beta : <prot>  beta activin </prot>  homodimer and alpha : <prot>  beta inhibin </prot>  heterodimer are mutual antagonists which share a common beta subunit .
Recently , it has been shown that , similar to <prot>  transforming growth factor - beta 1 </prot>  , activin is an inhibitor of hepatocyte DNA synthesis .
The activin receptor appears to be an obligatory complex of genetically distinct type I and II transmembrane serine / threonine kinases .
Activin type I receptors , <prot>  SKR1 </prot>  and <prot>  SKR2 </prot>  , were first cloned from well differentiated human hepatoma cells ( HepG2 ) .
This prompted us to investigate the binding of activin and inhibin to receptors from HepG2 cells and the effect of the two ligands on DNA synthesis .
Here we show that beta : <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  beta activin </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  binds to the <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  activin type II receptor kinase </prot>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  ActRII </prot>  </p2>  ) which induces activin binding to the type I receptor kinase <prot>  SKR2 </prot>  to form <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  ActRII </prot>  </p1>  .beta :beta .
 <p2  pair=4 >  <prot> SKR2 </prot>  </p2>  complexes in which an <prot>  activin beta </prot>  chain occupies each receptor subunit .
 <p1  pair=1 >  <prot> Inhibin </prot>  </p1>  also binds to <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  ActRII </prot>  </p2>  through its beta subunit , competes with the binding of activin to <prot>  ActRII </prot>  , but fails to form the <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  ActRII </prot>  </p1>  .
 <p2  pair=5 >  <prot> SKR2 </prot>  </p2>  complex .
No specific binding site for inhibin could be demonstrated in HepG2 cells .
 <prot> Inhibin </prot>  , which had no activity of its own , antagonized the inhibitory effect of activin on DNA synthesis .
The results suggest that inhibin may be a natural antagonist of assembly of the heterodimeric <prot>  activin receptor </prot>  complex through a dominant - negative mechanism .

Levels of <prot>  p21 </prot>  protein are increased in senescent cells and <prot>  p21 </prot>  overexpression blocks the growth of tumour cells .
In normal human cells , but not in many tumour cells , <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  p21 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  exists in a quaternary complex with a cyclin , a CDK , and the <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  proliferating - cell nuclear antigen </prot>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  PCNA </prot>  </p2>  ) .
 <prot> p21 </prot>  controls CDK activity , thereby affecting cell - cycle control , whereas <prot>  PCNA </prot>  functions in both DNA replication and repair .
Here we use simian virus 40 DNA replication in vitro to show than <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  p21 </prot>  </p1>  directly inhibits <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  PCNA </prot>  </p2>  - dependent DNA replication in the absence of a cyclin / CDK .
Furthermore , <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  p21 </prot>  </p1>  blocks the ability of <p1  pair=6 >  <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  PCNA </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  to activate <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  DNA polymerase delta </prot>  </p2>  , the principal replicative DNA polymerase .
This regulation results from a direct interaction between <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  p21 </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  PCNA </prot>  </p2>  .
Thus , during <prot>  p53 </prot>  - mediated suppression of cell proliferation , <prot>  p21 </prot>  and <prot>  PCNA </prot>  may be important for coordinating cell - cycle progression , DNA replication and repair of damaged DNA .

One model is that phosphorylation may allow the recruitment of coactivators which then interact with basal transcription factors .
We have previously identified a nuclear protein of M ( r ) 265K , <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  CBP </prot>  </p1>  , that binds specifically to the <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  PKA </prot>  </p1>  - phosphorylated form of <p2  pair=4 >  <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  CREB </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  .
We have used fluorescence anisotropy measurements to define the equilibrium binding parameters of the <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  phosphoCREB </prot>  </p1>  : <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  CBP </prot>  </p2>  interaction and report here that <prot>  CBP </prot>  can activate transcription through a region in its carboxy terminus .
The activation domain of <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  CBP </prot>  </p1>  interacts with the basal transcription factor <prot>  TFIIB </prot>  through a domain that is conserved in the yeast coactivator <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  ADA - 1 </prot>  </p2>  ( ref. 8 ) .
Consistent with its role as a coactivator , <p1  pair=8 >  <prot>  CBP </prot>  </p1>  augments the activity of phosphorylated <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  CREB </prot>  </p2>  to activate transcription of cAMP - responsive genes .

PG - 22379 - 84 AB - <prot>  HSP27 </prot>  , the unique mammalian low molecular weight heat shock protein , is prominently phosphorylated upon activation of a wide variety of cells and has a role in thermotolerance , growth events , and regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics .
In thrombin - stimulated platelets , <prot>  HSP27 </prot>  is rapidly and prominently phosphorylated in a manner highly correlated with platelet secretion .
However , the function of <prot>  HSP27 </prot>  and the identity of proteins that interact with <prot>  HSP27 </prot>  remain unknown .
To identify specific <prot>  HSP27 </prot>  - protein interactions , a recombinant fusion protein affinity reagent was constructed and used to identify proteins associating with <prot>  HSP27 </prot>  from human platelet lysates and erythroleukemia cells .
An 84 - kDa protein was found to associate specifically with <prot>  HSP27 </prot>  and was isolated from platelet lysates , resolved on preparative gels , transferred to nitrocellulose , subjected to enzymatic digestion , and microsequenced .
A 20 - amino acid sequence derived from p84 proved identical to amino acids 484 - 503 of the transglutaminase , platelet Factor XIII .
Immunoblotting studies were used to confirm the binding of <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  FXIII </prot>  </p1>  from fresh platelet lysates to the <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  HSP27 </prot>  </p2>  fusion protein .

The data thus demonstrate specific binding of platelet <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  FXIII </prot>  </p1>  to <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  HSP27 </prot>  </p2>  and suggest that <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  HSP27 </prot>  </p1>  may participate in the cellular localization and / or enzymatic regulation of platelet <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  FXIII </prot>  </p2>  .

PG - 1235 - 46 AB - The <prot>  p53 </prot>  tumor suppressor gene product is a transcriptional activator that may be associated with its ability to suppress tumor cell growth .
The acidic amino terminus of the <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  p53 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  protein has been shown to contain this trans - activation activity as well as the domains for <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  mdm - 2 </prot>  </p2>  and adenovirus <p2  pair=4 >  5 <prot>  E1B </prot>  </p2>  55 - kD protein binding .
An extensive genetic analysis of this amino - terminal <prot>  p53 </prot>  domain has been undertaken using site - specific mutagenesis .
The results demonstrate that the acidic residues in the amino terminus of <prot>  p53 </prot>  may contribute to , but are not critical for , this trans - activation activity .
Rather , the hydrophobic amino acid residues Leu - 22 and Trp - 23 of human <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  p53 </prot>  </p1>  are both required for trans - activation activity , binding to the adenovirus <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  E1B </prot>  </p2>  55 - kD protein and the human <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  mdm - 2 </prot>  </p1>  - <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  p53 </prot>  </p2>  protein in vitro .
In addition , hydrophobic residues Leu - 14 and Phe - 19 are crucial for the interactions between <p1  pair=7 >  <p1  pair=8 >  <prot>  p53 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  and human <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  mdm - 2 </prot>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  hdm - 2 </prot>  </p2>  ) .
Hydrophobic residues Trp - 23 and Pro - 27 are also important for binding to the adenovirus 5 ( Ad5 ) <prot>  E1B </prot>  55 - kD protein in vitro .
These mutations have no impact on the ability of the <prot>  p53 </prot>  protein to bind to a <prot>  p53 </prot>  - specific DNA element .
These results suggest that 2 - 4 critical hydrophobic residues in the amino - terminal domain of the <prot>  p53 </prot>  protein interact with the transcriptional machinery of the cell resulting in transcriptional activation .
These very same hydrophobic residues contact the <prot>  hdm - 2 </prot>  and Ad5 <prot>  E1B </prot>  55 - kD oncogene products .

TI - Type II regulatory subunit ( RII ) of the cAMP - dependent protein kinase interaction with A - kinase anchor proteins requires isoleucines 3 and 5 .
PG - 24245 - 51 AB - Compartmentalization of the <prot>  type II cAMP - dependent protein kinase </prot>  is maintained by association of the regulatory subunit ( RII ) with A - Kinase Anchor Proteins ( AKAPs ) .
In previous studies ( Scott , J. D. , Stofko , R. E. , McDonald , J. R. , Comer , J. D. , Vitalis , E. A. , and Mangili J. ( 1990 ) J. Biol. Chem. 265 , 21561 - 21566 ) we have shown that dimerization of <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  RII alpha </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  </p1>  was required for interaction with the cytoskeletal component <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  microtubule - associated protein 2 </prot>  </p2>  .
In this report we show that the localization and dimerization domains of <p1  pair=3 >  <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  RII alpha </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  are contained within the first thirty residues of each RII protomer .
 <p1  pair=4 >  <p2  pair=4 >  <prot> RII des - 5 </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  ( an amino - terminal deletion mutant lacking residues 1 - 5 ) was unable to bind AKAPs but retained the ability to dimerize .
 <prot> RII alpha </prot>  I3A , I5A ( a mutant where isoleucines 3 and 5 were replaced with alanine ) was unable to bind a variety of AKAPs .
Mutation of both isoleucines decreased AKAP binding without affecting dimerization , cAMP binding , or the overall secondary structure of the protein .
Measurement of <p1  pair=5 >  <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  RII alpha </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  I3A , I5A interaction with the human <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  thyroid AKAP </prot>  </p2>  , <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  Ht 31 </prot>  </p2>  , by two independent methods suggests that mutation of isoleucines 3 and 5 decreases affinity by at least 6 - fold .
Therefore , we propose that two isoleucine side chains on each RII protomer are principle sites of contact with the conserved amphipathic helix binding domain on AKAPs .

TI - Characterization of an interaction between <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  insulin receptor substrate 1 </prot>  </p1>  and the <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  insulin receptor </prot>  </p2>  by using the two - hybrid system .
PG - 6433 - 42 AB - <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  Insulin receptor substrate 1 </prot>  </p1>  ( <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  IRS - 1 </prot>  </p1>  ) is a major substrate of the <p2  pair=2 >  <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  insulin receptor </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  and has been implicated in <prot>  insulin </prot>  signaling .
Although <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  IRS - 1 </prot>  </p1>  is thought to interact with the <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  <prot>  insulin </prot>  receptor </prot>  </p2>  , the nature of the interaction has not been defined .
In this study , we used the two - hybrid assay of protein - protein interaction in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to study the interaction between human <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  IRS - 1 </prot>  </p1>  and the <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  <prot>  insulin </prot>  receptor </prot>  </p2>  .
We demonstrate that <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  IRS - 1 </prot>  </p1>  forms a specific complex with the cytoplasmic domain of the <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  insulin receptor </prot>  </p2>  when both are expressed as hybrid proteins in yeast cells .
We show that the interaction is strictly dependent upon receptor tyrosine kinase activity , since <prot>  IRS - 1 </prot>  shows no interaction with a kinase - inactive receptor hybrid containing a mutated ATP - binding site .
Furthermore , mutation of receptor tyrosine 960 to phenylalanine eliminates <prot>  IRS - 1 </prot>  interaction in the two - hybrid assay .
These data suggest that the interaction between <prot>  IRS - 1 </prot>  and the receptor is direct and provide evidence that the juxtamembrane domain of the receptor is involved .
Furthermore , we show that a 356 - amino - acid region encompassed by amino acids 160 through 516 of <prot>  IRS - 1 </prot>  is sufficient for interaction with the receptor in the two - hybrid assay .
Lastly , in agreement with our findings for yeast cells , we show that the <prot>  insulin receptor </prot>  is unable to phosphorylate an <prot>  IRS - 1 </prot>  protein containing a deletion of amino acids 45 to 516 when expressed in COS cells .
The two - hybrid assay should provide a facile means by which to pursue a detailed understanding of this interaction .

TI - Activation of <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  by 14 - 3 - 3 proteins .
PG - 612 - 4 AB - The protein <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  </p1>  , a key mediator of mitogenesis and differentiation , associates with <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  p21ras </prot>  </p2>  ( refs 1 - 3 ) .
However , the regulation of the serine / threonine kinase activity of <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  is still not understood .
Using the yeast two - hybrid system , we identified two structurally related proteins that interact with the aminoterminal region of <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  .
These proteins , <prot>  14 - 3 - 3 zeta </prot>  ( <prot>  PLA2 </prot>  ) and <prot>  14 - 3 - 3 beta </prot>  ( <prot>  HS1 </prot>  ) , are members of the 14 - 3 - 3 family of proteins .
Expression of 14 - 3 - 3 proteins in Xenopus oocytes enhanced <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  activity and promoted <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  - dependent oocyte maturation .
A dominant negative mutant of <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  blocked the effects of 14 - 3 - 3 protein .

TI - Interactions among members of the <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  protein family analyzed with a yeast two - hybrid system .
PG - 9238 - 42 AB - Interactions of the <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <p1  pair=5 >  <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  protein with itself and other members of the <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  family , including <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  Bcl - X - L </prot>  </p2>  , <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  Bcl - X - S </prot>  </p2>  , <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  Mcl - 1 </prot>  </p2>  , and <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  Bax </prot>  </p2>  , were explored with a yeast two - hybrid system .
Fusion proteins were created by linking <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  family proteins to a LexA DNA - binding domain or a B42 trans - activation domain .
Protein - protein interactions were examined by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae having a lacZ ( beta - galactosidase ) gene under control of a LexA - dependent operator .
This approach gave evidence for <p1  pair=6 >  <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  protein homodimerization .
 <p1  pair=10 >  <p1  pair=7 >  <p1  pair=8 >  <p1  pair=9 >  <prot> Bcl - 2 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  also interacted with <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  Bcl - X - L </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  Mcl - 1 </prot>  </p2>  and with the dominant inhibitors <p2  pair=9 >  <prot>  Bax </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=10 >  <prot>  Bcl - X - S </prot>  </p2>  .
 <prot> Bcl - X - L </prot>  displayed the same pattern of combinatorial interactions with <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  family proteins as <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  .
Use of deletion mutants of <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  suggested that <p1  pair=11 >  <p2  pair=11 >  <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  homodimerization involves interactions between two distinct regions within the <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  protein , since a LexA protein containing <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  amino acids 83 - 218 mediated functional interactions with a B42 fusion protein containing <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  amino acids 1 - 81 but did not complement a B42 fusion protein containing <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  amino acids 83 - 218 .
In contrast to LexA / <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  fusion proteins , expression of a LexA / <prot>  Bax </prot>  protein was lethal to yeast .
This cytotoxicity could be abrogated by B42 fusion proteins containing <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  , <prot>  Bcl - X - L </prot>  , or <prot>  Mcl - 1 </prot>  but not those containing <prot>  Bcl - X - S </prot>  ( an alternatively spliced form of <prot>  Bcl - X </prot>  that lacks a well - conserved 63 - amino acid region ) .
The findings suggest a model whereby <prot>  Bax </prot>  and <prot>  Bcl - X - S </prot>  differentially regulate <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  function , and indicate that requirements for <p1  pair=12 >  <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  </p1>  / <p2  pair=12 >  <prot>  Bax </prot>  </p2>  heterodimerization may be different from those for <p1  pair=13 >  <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  </p1>  / <p2  pair=13 >  <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  </p2>  homodimerization .

TI - The rates of commitment to renaturation of <prot>  rhodanese </prot>  and <prot>  glutamine synthetase </prot>  in the presence of the groE chaperonins .
PG - 29598 - 601 AB - Current models of chaperonin - assisted folding suggest that proteins undergo multiple rounds of binding and release before they are released in a form that is committed to folding to the native state .
Using immunoprecipitation techniques , we have determined the rates at which <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  rhodanese </prot>  </p1>  and <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  glutamine synthetase </prot>  </p1>  ( <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  GS </prot>  </p1>  ) are released from <p2  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=2 >  <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  groEL </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  </p2>  in a form committed to refold to active enzyme .
 <p1  pair=4 >  <prot> Rhodanese </prot>  </p1>  and <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  glutamine synthetase </prot>  </p1>  were chosen as substrates because they exhibit different solution requirements for the chaperonin system and they form stable AMPPPP quot ; folding arrested AMPPPP quot ; complexes with <p2  pair=4 >  <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  groEL </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  .
At various times during the groE - dependent renaturations , <prot>  groEL </prot>  was rapidly removed from the renaturation mixture by immunoprecipitation and centrifugation ( 30 s ) .
The conformers that are committed to the native state remained in the supernatant and were assayed after 1 h .
At 25 degrees C , the rate profiles indicate the release and commitment to folding of <prot>  GS </prot>  to its native state occurs far earlier ( t1 / 2 LTTTTT 1 min ) than for <prot>  rhodanese </prot>  ( t1 / 2 = 5 min ) .
In light of previous results , it appears that <prot>  GS </prot>  monomers can attain a groE - independent assembly competent conformation after a brief interaction with the chaperonin .
In contrast , the renaturation rate for <prot>  rhodanese </prot>  with the groE chaperonins mirrored the committed renaturation rates following <prot>  groEL </prot>  depletion .
This suggests that <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  rhodanese </prot>  </p1>  must interact with <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  groEL </prot>  </p2>  throughout most of its folding reaction before it acquires a folding competent ( groE independent ) state .
If current models of chaperonin mechanism are correct , <prot>  rhodanese </prot>  undergoes more rebinding and release cycles than does <prot>  GS </prot>  .
Structurally , the degree of cycling and hence the rate of commitment to folding to the active form are probably dictated by the hydrophobic nature , number , and lifetimes of the folding intermediates that interact with the chaperonins .

PG - 1042 - 5 AB - <prot>  Interleukin - 2 </prot>  ( <prot>  IL - 2 </prot>  ) signaling requires the dimerization of the <p1  pair=3 >  <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  <prot>  IL - 2 </prot>  receptor beta </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  ( <p1  pair=4 >  <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  IL - 2R beta </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  ) and common gamma ( gamma c ) chains .
Mutations of gamma c can result in X - linked severe combined immunodeficiency ( XSCID ) .
 <prot> IL - 2 </prot>  , <prot>  IL - 4 </prot>  , <prot>  IL - 7 </prot>  ( whose receptors are known to contain gamma c ) , and <prot>  IL - 9 </prot>  ( whose receptor is shown here to contain gamma c ) induced the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the Janus family tyrosine kinases <prot>  Jak1 </prot>  and <prot>  Jak3 </prot>  .
 <p1  pair=5 >  <prot> Jak1 </prot>  </p1>  and <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  Jak3 </prot>  </p1>  associated with <p2  pair=5 >  <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  IL - 2R beta </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  and gamma c , respectively ; <prot>  IL - 2 </prot>  induced <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  Jak3 </prot>  </p1>  - <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  IL - 2R beta </prot>  </p2>  and increased <prot>  Jak3 </prot>  - gamma c associations .
Truncations of gamma c , and a gamma c , point mutation causing moderate X - linked combined immunodeficiency ( XCID ) , decreased gamma c - <prot>  Jak3 </prot>  association .
Thus , gamma c mutations in at least some XSCID and XCID patients prevent normal <prot>  Jak3 </prot>  activation , suggesting that mutations of <prot>  Jak3 </prot>  may result in an XSCID - like phenotype .

TI - The X - ray structure of a <prot>  growth hormone </prot>  - <prot>  prolactin </prot>  receptor complex .
PG - 478 - 81 AB - The human pituitary hormones , <prot>  growth hormone </prot>  ( <prot>  hGH </prot>  ) and <prot>  prolactin </prot>  ( <prot>  hPRL </prot>  ) , regulate a large variety of physiological processes , among which are growth and differentiation of muscle , bone and cartilage cells , and lactation .
These activities are initiated by hormone - receptor binding .
The <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  hGH </prot>  </p1>  and <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  hPRL </prot>  </p1>  receptors ( <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  hGHR </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  hPRLR </prot>  </p2>  , respectively ) are single - pass transmembrane receptors from class 1 of the haematopoietic receptor superfamily .
This classification is based on sequence similarity in their extracellular domains , notably a highly conserved pentapeptide , the so - called ' WSXWS box ' , the function of which is controversial .
All ligands in class 1 activate their respective receptors by clustering mechanisms .
In the case of <prot>  hGH </prot>  , activation involves receptor homodimerization in a sequential process : the active ternary complex containing one ligand and two receptor molecules is formed by association of a receptor molecule to an intermediate 1:1 complex. <prot>  hPRL </prot>  does not bind to the <prot>  hGH </prot>  receptor , but <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  hGH </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  binds to both the <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  hGHR </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  hPRLR </prot>  </p2>  , and mutagenesis studies have shown that the receptor - binding sites on <prot>  hGH </prot>  overlap .
We present here the crystal structure of the 1:1 complex of <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  hGH </prot>  </p1>  bound to the extracellular domain of the <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  hPRLR </prot>  </p2>  .
Comparisons with the <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  hGH </prot>  </p1>  - <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  hGHR </prot>  </p2>  complex reveal how <prot>  hGH </prot>  can bind to the two distinctly different receptor binding surfaces .

 <prot> p23 </prot>  is also present in immunoaffinity - purified <prot>  hsp90 </prot>  complexes along with <prot>  hsp70 </prot>  and another protein , <prot>  p60 </prot>  .
Antibody and cDNA probes for <prot>  p23 </prot>  were prepared in an effort to elucidate the significance and function of this protein .
Antibodies to <prot>  p23 </prot>  detect similar levels of <prot>  p23 </prot>  in all tissues tested and cross - react with a protein of the same size in mice , rabbits , guinea pigs , humans , and Saccharomyces cerevisiae , indicating that <prot>  p23 </prot>  is a conserved protein of broad tissue distribution .
These antibodies were used to screen a chicken brain cDNA library , resulting in the isolation of a 468 - bp partial cDNA clone encoding a sequence containing four sequences corresponding to peptide fragments isolated from chicken <prot>  p23 </prot>  .
This partial clone was subsequently used to isolate a full - length human cDNA clone .
The human cDNA encodes a protein of 160 amino acids that does not show homology to previously identified proteins .
The chicken and human cDNAs are 88 % identical at the DNA level and 96.3 % identical at the protein level .

Mouse <prot>  IL - 10 </prot>  does not bind to <prot>  hIL - 10R </prot>  , and <prot>  hIL - 10R </prot>  - expressing Ba / F3 cells do not respond to the mouse cytokine , observations consistent with the known species specificity of <prot>  IL - 10 </prot>  .
Expression of <prot>  hIL - 10R </prot>  mRNA seems to be restricted mainly to human hemopoietic cells and cell lines .
In a number of human T cell clones , expression of <prot>  hIL - 10R </prot>  mRNA is down - regulated after activation of the cells with anti - <prot>  CD3 </prot>  Ab and phorbol ester .
The <prot>  hIL - 10R </prot>  gene is on human chromosome 11 .
Like <prot>  mIL - 10R </prot>  , <prot>  hIL - 10R </prot>  is structurally related to <prot>  IFNR </prot>  .
Because <prot>  IL - 10 </prot>  inhibits macrophage activation by <prot>  IFN - gamma </prot>  , this relationship suggests possible shared receptor or signal transduction pathway components .

Significantly , <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  Ha - Ras </prot>  </p1>  partially activates <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  JNK1 </prot>  </p2>  and potentiates the activation caused by UV .
 <p1  pair=3 >  <prot> JNK1 </prot>  </p1>  binds to the <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  c - Jun </prot>  </p2>  transactivation domain and phosphorylates it on Ser - 63 and Ser - 73 .
Thus , <prot>  JNK1 </prot>  is a component of a novel signal transduction pathway that is activated by oncoproteins and UV irradiation .
These properties indicate that <prot>  JNK1 </prot>  activation may play an important role in tumor promotion .

PG - 558 - 60 AB - A protein ligand for the <prot>  <prot>  ECK </prot>  receptor protein - tyrosine kinase </prot>  has been isolated by using the extracellular domain ( <prot>  ECK </prot>  - X ) of the receptor as an affinity reagent .
Initially , concentrated cell culture supernatants were screened for receptor binding activity using immobilized <prot>  ECK </prot>  - X in a surface plasmon resonance detection system .
Subsequently , supernatants from selected cell lines were fractionated directly by receptor affinity chromatography , resulting in the single - step purification of <prot>  B61 </prot>  , a protein previously identified as the product of an early response gene induced by <prot>  tumour necrosis factor - alpha </prot>  .
We report here that recombinant <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  B61 </prot>  </p1>  induces autophosphorylation of <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  ECK </prot>  </p2>  in intact cells , consistent with <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  B61 </prot>  </p1>  being an authentic ligand for <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  ECK </prot>  </p2>  .
 <prot> ECK </prot>  is a member of a large orphan receptor protein - tyrosine kinase family headed by EPH , and we suggest that ligands for other members of this family will be related to <prot>  B61 </prot>  , and can be isolated in the same way .

TI - A <prot>  lymphotoxin - beta </prot>  - specific receptor .
PG - 707 - 10 AB - Tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) and <prot>  lymphotoxin - alpha </prot>  ( <prot>  LT - alpha </prot>  ) are members of a family of secreted and cell surface cytokines that participate in the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses .
The cell surface form of <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  LT - alpha </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  is assembled during biosynthesis as a heteromeric complex with <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  lymphotoxin - beta </prot>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  LT - beta </prot>  </p2>  ) , a type II transmembrane protein that is another member of the TNF ligand family .
Secreted <p1  pair=3 >  <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  LT - alpha </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  is a homotrimer that binds to distinct TNF receptors of 60 and 80 kilodaltons ; however , these receptors do not recognize the major cell surface <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  LT - alpha </prot>  </p1>  - <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  LT - beta </prot>  </p2>  complex .
A receptor specific for human <prot>  LT - beta </prot>  was identified , which suggests that cell surface LT may have functions that are distinct from those of secreted <prot>  LT - alpha </prot>  .

TI - Cloning of a T cell growth factor that interacts with the beta chain of the <prot>  interleukin - 2 receptor </prot>  .
PG - 965 - 8 AB - A cytokine was identified that stimulated the proliferation of T lymphocytes , and a complementary DNA clone encoding this new T cell growth factor was isolated .
The cytokine , designated <prot>  interleukin - 15 </prot>  ( <prot>  IL - 15 </prot>  ) , is produced by a wide variety of cells and tissues and shares many biological properties with <prot>  IL - 2 </prot>  .
Monoclonal antibodies to the beta chain of the <prot>  IL - 2 </prot>  receptor inhibited the biological activity of <prot>  IL - 15 </prot>  , and <prot>  IL - 15 </prot>  competed for binding with <prot>  IL - 2 </prot>  , indicating that <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  IL - 15 </prot>  </p1>  uses components of the <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  <prot>  IL - 2 </prot>  receptor </prot>  </p2>  .

TI - The POU domains of the <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  Oct1 </prot>  </p1>  and <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  Oct2 </prot>  </p1>  transcription factors mediate specific interaction with <p2  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  TBP </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  .
PG - 1655 - 62 AB - We had previously shown that the ubiquitous <prot>  Oct1 </prot>  and the lymphoid - specific <prot>  Oct2 </prot>  transcription factors stimulate transcription at the level of stable preinitiation complex formation .
We have therefore investigated whether the octamer binding proteins might physically interact with <prot>  TBP </prot>  , the <prot>  TATA box binding protein </prot>  component of the <prot>  TFIID </prot>  factor .
By using several different experimental systems we show that <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  TBP </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  efficiently associates with <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  Oct1 </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  Oct2 </prot>  </p2>  .
The interaction is direct and does not depend on the presence of DNA or additional proteins .
N - and C - terminal deletions of the different proteins were used to localize the domains involved in the interaction .
We show that the POU homeodomain of <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  Oct2 </prot>  </p1>  and the evolutionarily conserved C - terminal core domain of <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  TBP </prot>  </p2>  are both required and sufficient for the interaction .
The <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  Oct1 </prot>  </p1>  POU domain , which is highly homologous to the <prot>  Oct2 </prot>  POU domain , likewise mediates interaction with <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  TBP </prot>  </p2>  .
The interaction can also be observed in vivo , as <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  TBP </prot>  </p1>  can be co - precipitated with <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  Oct2 </prot>  </p2>  from co - transfected Cos1 cells and <p1  pair=8 >  <prot>  TBP </prot>  </p1>  co - immunoprecipitates with the endogenous <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  Oct1 </prot>  </p2>  from HeLa cells .
Co - transfection of human <prot>  TBP </prot>  and <prot>  Oct2 </prot>  expression vectors into B cells resulted in a synergistic activation of an octamer motif containing promoter .

PG - 102 - 5 AB - In the assembly of a prespliceosome , <prot>  U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein </prot>  ( snRNP ) functions in pre - messenger RNA ( mRNA ) splicing together with splicing factors ( SFs ) 3a , <prot>  SF3b </prot>  , and several other proteins .
The 17S but not the 12S form of <prot>  U2 snRNP </prot>  is active in splicing - complex formation .
Here it is shown that the <prot>  SF3a </prot>  subunits correspond to three of the 17S <prot>  U2 snRNP </prot>  - specific polypeptides .
 <p1  pair=2 >  <prot> SF3a </prot>  </p1>  interacts with <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  U2 snRNP </prot>  </p2>  in the presence of <prot>  SF3b </prot>  to generate a structure similar to 17S <prot>  U2 snRNP </prot>  , which suggests a function for <prot>  SF3a </prot>  and <prot>  SF3b </prot>  in the incorporation of <prot>  U2 snRNP </prot>  into the spliceosome .
Furthermore , the 60 - kilodalton subunit of <prot>  SF3a </prot>  is related to the yeast splicing protein <prot>  PRP9 </prot>  .

TI - <prot>  Spectrin cagliari </prot>  . an Ala -- GTTTTT Gly substitution in helix 1 of <prot>  beta spectrin </prot>  repeat 17 that severely disrupts the structure and self - association of the erythrocyte spectrin heterodimer .
PG - 22656 - 62 AB - The spectrin tetramer , the principal structural element of the red cell membrane skeleton , is formed by stable head - to - head self - association of two spectrin heterodimers .
The self - association site appears to be formed by interactions between helices 1 and 2 of <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  beta spectrin </prot>  </p1>  repeat 17 of one dimer with helix 3 of <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  alpha spectrin </prot>  </p2>  repeat 1 of the other dimer to form two combined alpha - beta triple - helical segments .
The head of the heterodimer appears to involve similar intradimer interactions .
We describe the first example of an amino acid substitution in helix 1 of this combined alpha - beta triple - helical segment , which , although relatively minor , profoundly impairs tetramer formation .
Strikingly , low angle rotary shadowing electron microscopy of isolated spectrin dimers reveals that this mutation also severely disrupts the head of the heterodimer causing it to be open .
Following linkage studies which were most consistent with a <prot>  beta spectrin </prot>  gene mutation , a nucleotide change was identified in codon 2018 , resulting in an Ala -- GTTTTT Gly substitution in the first helical domain of <prot>  beta spectrin </prot>  repeat 17 .
Because glycine is a strong helix breaker , this change is predicted to disrupt the conformation of this helical domain .
Our results indicate that this helical domain must play direct roles in the alpha - beta interdimer interactions that form the self - association site of the tetramer and in the alpha - beta intradimer interactions at the head of the heterodimer .

PG - 791 - 803 AB - We used the interaction trap , a yeast genetic selection for interacting proteins , to isolate human <prot>  cyclin - dependent kinase interactor 1 </prot>  ( <prot>  Cdi1 </prot>  ) .
In yeast , <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  Cdi1 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  interacts with cyclin - dependent kinases , including human <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  Cdc2 </prot>  </p2>  , <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  Cdk2 </prot>  </p2>  , and <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  Cdk3 </prot>  </p2>  , but not with <prot>  Cdk4 </prot>  .
In HeLa cells , <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  Cdi1 </prot>  </p1>  is expressed at the G1 to S transition , and the protein forms stable complexes with <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  Cdk2 </prot>  </p2>  .
 <prot> Cdi1 </prot>  bears weak sequence similarity to known tyrosine and dual specificity phosphatases .
In vitro , <prot>  Cdi1 </prot>  removes phosphate from tyrosine residues in model substrates , but a mutant protein that bears a lesion in the putative active site cysteine does not .
Overexpression of wild - type <prot>  Cdi1 </prot>  delays progression through the cell cycle in yeast and HeLa cells ; delay is dependent on <prot>  Cdi1 </prot>  phosphatase activity .
These experiments identify <prot>  Cdi1 </prot>  as a novel type of protein phosphatase that forms complexes with cyclin - dependent kinases .

TI - The <prot>  p21 </prot>  Cdk - interacting protein <prot>  Cip1 </prot>  is a potent inhibitor of G1 cyclin - dependent kinases .

To identify potential <prot>  Cdk2 </prot>  regulators , we have employed an improved two - hybrid system to isolate human genes encoding Cdk - interacting proteins ( Cips ) .
 <prot> CIP1 </prot>  encodes a novel 21 kd protein that is found in <prot>  cyclin A </prot>  , <prot>  cyclin D1 </prot>  , <prot>  cyclin E </prot>  , and <prot>  Cdk2 </prot>  immunoprecipitates .
 <prot> p21CIP1 </prot>  is a potent , tight - binding inhibitor of Cdks and can inhibit the phosphorylation of <prot>  Rb </prot>  by <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  cyclin A </prot>  </p1>  - <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  Cdk2 </prot>  </p2>  , <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  cyclin E </prot>  </p1>  - <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  Cdk2 </prot>  </p2>  , <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  cyclin D1 </prot>  </p1>  - <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  Cdk4 </prot>  </p2>  , and <p1  pair=8 >  <prot>  cyclin D2 </prot>  </p1>  - <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  Cdk4 </prot>  </p2>  complexes .

PG - 6145 - 9 AB - Two promoter elements are important for basal - level transcription , the TATA motif typically located 30 nucleotides upstream of the transcription initiation site and the initiator ( Inr ) element encompassing the start site .
The mechanism of how Inr elements work is poorly understood , partly because very few proteins that bind to Inr elements have been identified and isolated .
The recently cloned <prot>  YY1 </prot>  is such an <prot>  Inr - binding protein </prot>  .
 <prot> YY1 </prot>  is able to direct transcription upon binding to its recognition sequence in vitro .
The ability of <prot>  YY1 </prot>  to initiate transcription is augmented by the presence of a TATA motif or binding sites for transcription factor <prot>  Sp1 </prot>  .
To study the mechanism underlying the apparent functional cooperation between <prot>  YY1 </prot>  and <prot>  Sp1 </prot>  , we explored the possibility of protein - protein interactions between these two transcription factors .
We found that <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  YY1 </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  Sp1 </prot>  </p2>  can form a physical complex .
In addition , we identified domains within <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  YY1 </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  Sp1 </prot>  </p2>  that mediate their interactions with each other .
The physical interaction between <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  YY1 </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  Sp1 </prot>  </p2>  may thus form the basis for the functional interplay observed previously .

TI - Involvement of <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  signal transducer <prot>  gp130 </prot>  in <prot>  IL - 11 </prot>  - mediated signal transduction .
PG - 2555 - 61 AB - <prot>  IL - 11 </prot>  is a novel cytokine with a variety of biofunctions which overlap with those of <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  .
We have previously identified <prot>  IL - 11 </prot>  specific binding protein which is distinct from that of <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  in a number of cell lines .
The similarities in biofunctions and differences in ligand binding proteins between <prot>  IL - 11 </prot>  and <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  prompted us to investigate whether <prot>  IL - 11 </prot>  shares common signal transduction mechanisms with <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  .
We have examined early signals triggered by <prot>  IL - 11 </prot>  or <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  in a multifactor - dependent human erythroleukemic cell line , TF - 1 .
The results showed that <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  IL - 11 </prot>  </p1>  and <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  </p1>  can both stimulate cell proliferation , induce similar pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation , and activate the same proto - oncogene ( <p2  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  junB </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  ) expression in TF - 1 cells .
These findings imply that <prot>  IL - 11 </prot>  and <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  share similar early signaling events with the possibility of using the same signal transducer , <prot>  gp130 </prot>  .
We next tested whether <prot>  IL - 11 </prot>  induced signaling can be inhibited by anti - <prot>  gp130 </prot>  antibodies which blocked <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  - mediated functions .
It was observed that anti - <prot>  gp130 </prot>  antibodies abolished cell proliferation , protein tyrosine phosphorylation , and <prot>  junB </prot>  gene expression elicited by <prot>  IL - 11 </prot>  or <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  in TF - 1 cells .
The same antibodies , however , had no effect on granulocyte - macrophage colony stimulating factor or erythropoietin - induced TF - 1 cell proliferation .
Finally , anti - <prot>  IL - 6R </prot>  antibody inhibited the ability of <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  , but not <prot>  IL - 11 </prot>  , to transduce early signals in TF - 1 cells .
These results demonstrate that <prot>  IL - 11 </prot>  and <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  utilize different ligand binding proteins , but share common signal transducer , <prot>  gp130 </prot>  , in TF - 1 cells .

PG - 555 - 69 AB - The <prot>  retinoblastoma protein </prot>  ( <prot>  p110RB </prot>  ) interacts with many cellular proteins in complexes potentially important for its growth - suppressing function .
We have developed and used an improved version of the yeast two - hybrid system to isolate human cDNAs encoding proteins able to bind <prot>  p110RB </prot>  .
One clone encodes a novel <prot>  type 1 protein phosphatase </prot>  catalytic subunit ( <prot>  PP - 1 alpha 2 </prot>  ) , which differs from the originally defined <prot>  PP - 1 alpha </prot>  by an amino - terminal 11 - amino - acid insert .
In vitro - binding assays demonstrated that <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  PP - 1 alpha </prot>  </p1>  isoforms preferentially bind the hypophosphorylated form of <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  p110RB </prot>  </p2>  .
Moreover , similar <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  p110RB </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  sequences are required for binding <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  PP - 1 alpha 2 </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  SV40 large T antigen </prot>  </p2>  .

TI - Crystal structure of the soluble human 55 kd TNF receptor - human <prot>  TNF beta </prot>  complex : implications for TNF receptor activation .
PG - 431 - 45 AB - The X - ray crystal structure of the complex of the extracellular domain of the human 55 kd tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) receptor with human <prot>  TNF beta </prot>  has been determined at 2.85 A resolution .
The complex has three receptor molecules bound symmetrically to one <p1  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  TNF beta </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  trimer .
The receptor fragment , a very elongated end to end assembly of four similar folding domains , binds in the groove between two adjacent <prot>  TNF beta </prot>  subunits .
The structure of the complex defines the orientation of the ligand with respect to the cell membrane and provides a model for TNF receptor activation .

Expression on T cells and association with <prot>  IL - 7 </prot>  driven proliferation .
PG - 4753 - 63 AB - Although both unstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity <prot>  IL - 7R </prot>  , only activated T cells can proliferate to IL - 7 .
This responsiveness may occur as a direct result of changes in the structure of the <prot>  IL - 7R </prot>  during T - cell activation .
We have previously demonstrated such changes by affinity cross - linking studies , and have shown that unstimulated human T cells express a single <prot>  IL - 7R </prot>  of 90 kDa , whereas activated T cells express an additional 76 - kDa <prot>  IL - 7 </prot>  binding protein .
In this study the origin and function of the <prot>  p90 </prot>  and <prot>  p76 </prot>  molecules have been investigated .
To determine the role of each of these receptors in <prot>  IL - 7 </prot>  driven proliferation , <prot>  IL - 7R </prot>  expression and proliferative capacity were monitored during mitogenic stimulation .
These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to <prot>  IL - 7 </prot>  correlated with expression of the <prot>  p76 </prot>  <prot>  IL - 7R </prot>  , and not with expression of the <prot>  p90 </prot>  <prot>  IL - 7R </prot>  .
 <prot> IL - 7 </prot>  - driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity <prot>  IL - 7R </prot>  , and accordingly , Scatchard analysis revealed that , like the <prot>  p90 </prot>  <prot>  IL - 7R </prot>  , the <prot>  p76 </prot>  <prot>  IL - 7R </prot>  bound <prot>  IL - 7 </prot>  with dual ( high ; Kd 38 pM and low ; Kd 360 pM ) affinity .
Deglycosylation studies showed that the <prot>  p90 </prot>  and <prot>  p76 </prot>  <prot>  IL - 7R </prot>  are not simply differently glycosylated isoforms of a single receptor .
In agreement , mAb to the previously cloned <prot>  IL - 7R </prot>  were found to stain unstimulated T cells that express only the <prot>  p90 </prot>  <prot>  IL - 7R </prot>  but not T - cell clones that express predominantly the <prot>  p76 </prot>  <prot>  IL - 7R </prot>  .
These antibodies also immunoprecipitated the cloned <prot>  IL - 7R </prot>  as a 90 - kDa species from both 125 - I - surface - labeled resting and activated T cells , but were unable to precipitate the 76 - kDa <prot>  IL - 7R </prot>  .
In addition , PCR analysis of <prot>  p76 </prot>  - expressing cells could not detect splicing of the extracellular domain of the cloned <prot>  IL - 7R </prot>  , thereby excluding the possibility that the <prot>  p76 </prot>  <prot>  IL - 7R </prot>  is a previously undescribed splice variant of the cloned <prot>  IL - 7R </prot>  .
These data demonstrate that the <prot>  p90 </prot>  <prot>  IL - 7R </prot>  is the T - cell homologue of the cloned <prot>  IL - 7R </prot>  , and imply that the <prot>  p90 </prot>  and <prot>  p76 </prot>  <prot>  IL - 7R </prot>  have different extracellular domains .
Taken together these data suggest that the 76 - kDa receptor is a novel high affinity <prot>  IL - 7R </prot>  that may be necessary for <prot>  IL - 7 </prot>  driven proliferation in human T cells .

PG - 3149 - 56 AB - The <prot>  retinoblastoma </prot>  gene product , <prot>  pRB </prot>  , regulates cell proliferation by binding to and inhibiting the activity of key growth promoting proteins .
Several cellular proteins have been shown to bind directly to <prot>  pRB </prot>  and the genes encoding a number of them have been isolated .
The protein product of one of these genes is the transcription factor <prot>  E2F </prot>  .
We have now isolated cDNA clones that contain the full - length coding sequence of two other proteins , <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  RBP1 </prot>  </p1>  and <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  RBP2 </prot>  </p1>  , cloned originally by their interaction with <p2  pair=3 >  <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  pRB </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  .

The distribution of <prot>  cyclin D </prot>  isoforms was modulated by serum factors in primary fetal rat lung epithelial cells .
Moreover , <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  cyclin D1 </prot>  </p1>  was found to be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in vivo and , like <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  cyclin A </prot>  </p1>  , was readily phosphorylated by <p2  pair=3 >  <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  pp60c - src </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  in vitro .
In synchronized human osteosarcoma cells , <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  cyclin D1 </prot>  </p1>  is induced in early G1 and becomes associated with <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  p9Ckshs1 </prot>  </p2>  , a Cdk - binding subunit .
Immunoprecipitation experiments with human osteosarcoma cells and Ewing 's sarcoma cells demonstrated that <p1  pair=6 >  <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  cyclin D1 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  is associated with both <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  p34cdc2 </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  p33cdk2 </prot>  </p2>  , and that <prot>  cyclin D1 </prot>  immune complexes exhibit appreciable histone H1 kinase activity .
Immobilized , recombinant cyclins A and D1 were found to associate with cellular proteins in complexes that contain the <prot>  p105Rb </prot>  protein .
This study identifies several common aspects of cyclin biochemistry , including tyrosine phosphorylation and the potential to interact directly or indirectly with the <prot>  Rb </prot>  protein , that may ultimately relate membrane - mediated signaling events to the regulation of gene expression .

TI - The SH2 / SH3 domain - containing protein <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  GRB2 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  interacts with tyrosine - phosphorylated <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  IRS1 </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  Shc </prot>  </p2>  : implications for insulin control of <prot>  ras </prot>  signalling .
PG - 1929 - 36 AB - <prot>  GRB2 </prot>  , a small protein comprising one SH2 domain and two SH3 domains , represents the human homologue of the Caenorhabditis elegans protein , <prot>  sem - 5 </prot>  .
Both <prot>  GRB2 </prot>  and <prot>  sem - 5 </prot>  have been implicated in a highly conserved mechanism that regulates <prot>  p21ras </prot>  signalling by receptor tyrosine kinases .
In this report we show that in response to <prot>  insulin </prot>  , <prot>  GRB2 </prot>  forms a stable complex with two tyrosine - phosphorylated proteins .
One protein is the major insulin receptor substrate <prot>  IRS - 1 </prot>  and the second is the SH2 domain - containing oncogenic protein , <prot>  Shc </prot>  .
The interactions between <prot>  GRB2 </prot>  and these two proteins require ligand activation of the <prot>  insulin receptor </prot>  and are mediated by the binding of the SH2 domain of <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  GRB2 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  to phosphotyrosines on both <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  IRS - 1 </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  Shc </prot>  </p2>  .
Although <p1  pair=5 >  <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  GRB2 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  associates with <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  IRS - 1 </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  Shc </prot>  </p2>  , it is not tyrosine - phosphorylated after <prot>  insulin </prot>  stimulation , implying that <prot>  GRB2 </prot>  is not a substrate for the insulin receptor .
Furthermore , we have identified a short sequence motif ( YV / IN ) present in <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  IRS - 1 </prot>  </p1>  , <p1  pair=8 >  <prot>  EGFR </prot>  </p1>  and <p1  pair=9 >  <prot>  Shc </prot>  </p1>  , which specifically binds the SH2 domain of <p2  pair=7 >  <p2  pair=8 >  <p2  pair=9 >  <prot>  GRB2 </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  </p2>  with high affinity .
Interestingly , both <p1  pair=10 >  <prot>  GRB2 </prot>  </p1>  and <p1  pair=11 >  <prot>  phosphatidylinositol - 3 ( PI - 3 ) kinase </prot>  </p1>  can simultaneously bind distinct tyrosine phosphorylated regions on the same <p2  pair=10 >  <p2  pair=11 >  <prot>  IRS - 1 </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  molecule , suggesting a mechanism whereby <prot>  IRS - 1 </prot>  could provide the core for a large signalling complex .
We propose a model whereby insulin stimulation leads to formation of multiple protein -- protein interactions between <p1  pair=12 >  <p1  pair=13 >  <prot>  GRB2 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  and the two targets <p2  pair=12 >  <prot>  IRS - 1 </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=13 >  <prot>  Shc </prot>  </p2>  .
These interactions may play a crucial role in activation of <prot>  p21ras </prot>  and the control of downstream effector molecules .

TI - Regulation of the <prot>  Ets </prot>  - related transcription factor <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  Elf - 1 </prot>  </p1>  by binding to the <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  retinoblastoma </prot>  </p2>  protein .
PG - 1330 - 5 AB - The <prot>  retinoblastoma </prot>  gene product ( <prot>  Rb </prot>  ) is a nuclear phosphoprotein that regulates cell cycle progression .
 <prot> Elf - 1 </prot>  is a lymphoid - specific <prot>  Ets </prot>  transcription factor that regulates inducible gene expression during T cell activation .
In this report , it is demonstrated that <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  Elf - 1 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  contains a sequence motif that is highly related to the <prot>  Rb </prot>  binding sites of several viral oncoproteins and binds to the pocket region of <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  Rb </prot>  </p2>  both in vitro and in vivo .
 <prot> Elf - 1 </prot>  binds exclusively to the underphosphorylated form of <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  Rb </prot>  </p2>  and fails to bind to <prot>  Rb </prot>  mutants derived from patients with retinoblastoma .
Co - immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated an association between <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  Elf - 1 </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  Rb </prot>  </p2>  in resting normal human T cells .
After T cell activation , the phosphorylation of <prot>  Rb </prot>  results in the release of <prot>  Elf - 1 </prot>  , which is correlated temporally with the activation of <prot>  Elf - 1 </prot>  - mediated transcription .
Overexpression of a phosphorylation - defective form of <prot>  Rb </prot>  inhibited <prot>  Elf - 1 </prot>  - dependent transcription during T cell activation .
These results demonstrate that <prot>  Rb </prot>  interacts specifically with a lineage - restricted <prot>  Ets </prot>  transcription factor .
This regulated interaction may be important for the coordination of lineage - specific effector functions such as lymphokine production with cell cycle progression in activated T cells .

TI - Cloning of two proximal sequence element - binding transcription factor subunits ( gamma and delta ) that are required for transcription of small nuclear RNA genes by RNA polymerases II and III and interact with the <prot>  TATA - binding protein </prot>  .
PG - 1 - 9 AB - The <prot>  proximal sequence element ( PSE ) - binding transcription factor </prot>  ( <prot>  PTF </prot>  ) specifically recognizes the PSEs of both RNA polymerase II - and RNA polymerase III - transcribed small nuclear RNA ( snRNA ) genes .
We previously have shown that <prot>  PTF </prot>  purified from human HeLa cells is a multisubunit complex of four polypeptides designated <prot>  <prot>  PTF </prot>  alpha </prot>  , - beta , - gamma , and - delta .
We now report the isolation and expression of cDNAs encoding <prot>  PTF </prot>  gamma and <prot>  PTF </prot>  delta , as well as functional studies with cognate antibodies that recognize the native <prot>  PTF </prot>  complex in HeLa extracts .
Immunoprecipitation studies confirm that the four <prot>  PTF </prot>  subunits originally found to copurify during conventional chromatography indeed form a tightly associated complex ; they further show that the <prot>  PTF </prot>  so defined , including the gamma and delta subunits specifically , is essential for transcription of both class II and class III snRNA genes .
Immunoprecipitation assays also show a weak substoichiometric association of the <prot>  TATA - binding protein </prot>  ( <prot>  TBP </prot>  ) with <prot>  PTF </prot>  , consistent with the previous report of a <prot>  PTF </prot>  - related complex ( <prot>  SNAPc </prot>  ) containing substoichiometric levels of <prot>  TBP </prot>  and a component ( <prot>  SNAPc43 </prot>  ) identical in sequence to the <prot>  PTF </prot>  gamma reported here .
Glutathione S - transferase pulldown assays further indicate relatively strong direct interactions of both recombinant <prot>  PTF </prot>  gamma and <prot>  PTF </prot>  delta with <prot>  TBP </prot>  , consistent either with the natural association of <prot>  TBP </prot>  with <prot>  PTF </prot>  in a semistable <prot>  TBP </prot>  - <prot>  TBP </prot>  - associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE - bound <prot>  PTF </prot>  and TATA - bound <prot>  TBP </prot>  during promoter activation .
In addition , we show that in extracts depleted of <prot>  TBP </prot>  and <prot>  TBP </prot>  - associated factors , transcription from the U1 promoter is restored by recombinant <prot>  TBP </prot>  but not by <prot>  TFIID </prot>  or <prot>  TFIIIB </prot>  , indicating that transcription of class II snRNA genes requires a <prot>  TBP </prot>  complex different from the one used for mRNA - encoding genes .

PG - 299 - 308 AB - Tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) can induce apoptosis and activate <prot>  NF - kappa B </prot>  through signaling cascades emanating from <prot>  TNF receptor 1 </prot>  ( <prot>  TNFR1 </prot>  ) .
 <prot> TRADD </prot>  is a <prot>  TNFR1 </prot>  - associated signal transducer that is involved in activating both pathways .
Here we show that <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  TRADD </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  directly interacts with <p1  pair=5 >  <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  TRAF2 </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  and <p1  pair=6 >  <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  FADD </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  , signal transducers that activate <p2  pair=5 >  <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  NF - kappa B </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  and induce apoptosis , respectively .
A <prot>  TRAF2 </prot>  mutant lacking its N - terminal RING finger domain is a dominant - negative inhibitor of TNF - mediated <prot>  NF - kappa B </prot>  activation , but does not affect TNF - induced apoptosis .
Conversely , a <prot>  FADD </prot>  mutant lacking its N - terminal 79 amino acids is a dominant - negative inhibitor of TNF - induced apoptosis , but does not inhibit <prot>  NF - kappa B </prot>  activation .
Thus , these two <prot>  TNFR1 </prot>  - <prot>  TRADD </prot>  signaling cascades appear to bifurcate at <prot>  TRADD </prot>  .

PG - 1349 - 55 AB - <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  CD26 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  , a T cell activation Ag , also known as <p1  pair=4 >  <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  dipeptidyl peptidase IV </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  is directly associated with <p2  pair=2 >  <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  adenosine deaminase </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=3 >  <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  ADA </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  ) on the surface of T cells and T cell lines .
In the present study , we examined both the binding of <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  ADA </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  CD26 </prot>  </p2>  and the functional consequences of this interaction .
We found that <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  ADA </prot>  </p1>  was associated with <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  CD26 </prot>  </p2>  on T cell lines lacking either <prot>  ADA </prot>  or <prot>  dipeptidyl peptidase IV </prot>  enzymatic activity , indicating that the association between <p1  pair=8 >  <prot>  dipeptidyl peptidase IV </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  ADA </prot>  </p2>  did not require enzymatic activity .
Moreover , using immunoelectron microscopy , we demonstrated that <prot>  CD26 </prot>  and <prot>  ADA </prot>  co - localized on the cell surface , but not inside cells , suggesting that <prot>  CD26 </prot>  did not transport <prot>  ADA </prot>  to the surface .
In keeping with this observation , we showed that human <prot>  CD26 </prot>  - transfected murine pre - B cell lines lacking human <prot>  ADA </prot>  acquired <prot>  ADA </prot>  from an extracellular source .
More importantly , adenosine in the absence of cell surface <prot>  ADA </prot>  inhibited T cell proliferation and <prot>  IL - 2 </prot>  production induced by various stimuli .
On the other hand , cells expressing <prot>  ADA </prot>  and <prot>  CD26 </prot>  on the surface were much more resistant to the inhibitory effect of adenosine .
These data suggest that <prot>  ADA </prot>  on the cell surface is involved in an important immunoregulatory mechanism by which released <p1  pair=9 >  <prot>  ADA </prot>  </p1>  binds to cell surface <p2  pair=9 >  <prot>  CD26 </prot>  </p2>  , and this complex is capable of reducing the local concentration of adenosine .

PG - 2724 - 30 AB - The syntrophins are a biochemically heterogeneous group of 58 - kDa intracellular membrane - associated <prot>  dystrophin </prot>  - binding proteins .
We have cloned and characterized human <prot>  acidic ( alpha 1 - ) syntrophin </prot>  and a second isoform of human <prot>  basic ( beta 2 - ) syntrophin </prot>  .
Comparison of the deduced amino acid structure of the three human isoforms of syntrophin ( together with the previously reported human <prot>  beta 1 - syntrophin </prot>  ) demonstrates their overall similarity .
The deduced amino acid sequences of human alpha 1 - and <prot>  beta 2 - syntrophin </prot>  are nearly identical to their homologues in mouse , suggesting a strong functional conservation among the individual isoforms , Much like <prot>  beta 1 - syntrophin </prot>  , human <prot>  beta 2 - syntrophin </prot>  has multiple transcript classes and is expressed widely , although in a distinct pattern of relative abundance .
In contrast , human <prot>  alpha 1 - syntrophin </prot>  is most abundant in heart and skeletal muscle , and less so in other tissues .
Somatic cell hybrids and fluorescent in situ hybridization were both used to determine their chromosomal locations : <prot>  beta 2 - syntrophin </prot>  to chromosome 16q22 - 23 and <prot>  alpha 1 - syntrophin </prot>  to chromosome 20q11.2 .
Finally , we used in vitro translated proteins in an immunoprecipitation assay to show that , like <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=5 >  <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  beta 1 - syntrophin </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  , both beta 2 - and <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <p1  pair=6 >  <p1  pair=8 >  <prot>  alpha 1 - syntrophin </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  interact with peptides encoding the syntrophin - binding region of <p2  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  dystrophin </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  , <p2  pair=3 >  <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  utrophin </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  / <p2  pair=5 >  <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  <prot>  dystrophin </prot>  related protein </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  , and the <p2  pair=7 >  <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  Torpedo 87K protein </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  .

TI - A histone octamer - like structure within <prot>  TFIID </prot>  .
PG - 356 - 9 AB - The general transcription factor <prot>  TFIID </prot>  nucleates initiation complex formation through direct core promoter binding , commits promoters within chromatin to transcription , and mediates the action of transcriptional activators , a phenomenon that may correlate with enhanced <prot>  TFIID </prot>  recruitment or conformational changes in <prot>  TFIID </prot>  - promoter complexes .
Molecular studies of the multiprotein <prot>  TFIID </prot>  complex have identified a primary <prot>  TATA binding subunit </prot>  ( <prot>  TBP </prot>  ) , TBP - associated factors ( TAFs ) that interact with and mediate the function of activators and intersubunit interactions but have yielded relatively little insight into the structural organization of the complex or the actual mechanism of transcriptional activation .

A protein kinase designated <prot>  IRAK </prot>  ( <prot>  <prot>  IL - 1 </prot>  receptor - associated kinase </prot>  ) was purified , and its complementary DNA was molecularly cloned .

We have localized the region of interaction to tyrosine 580 in the carboxyl end of <prot>  SHPTP2 </prot>  and to the SH2 domain in the carboxy - terminus of <prot>  Grb7 </prot>  .
We demonstrate that <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  Grb7 </prot>  </p1>  binds to <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  SHPTP2 </prot>  </p2>  in vitro under conditions where the latter is tyrosine - phosphorylated .
These experiments show that this modified two hybrid technique may be useful for the identification of proteins involved in tyrosine kinase signal transduction cascades .

TI - Modulation of the transcriptional activity of thyroid hormone receptors by the tumor suppressor <prot>  p53 </prot>  .
PG - 4273 - 7 AB - Thyroid hormone nuclear receptors ( TRs ) are ligand - dependent transcriptional factors that regulate growth , differentiation , and development .
The molecular mechanisms by which TRs mediate these effects are unclear .
One prevailing hypothesis suggests that TRs may cooperate with other transcriptional factors to mediate their biological effects .
In this study , we tested this hypothesis by examining whether the activity of TRs is modulated by the tumor suppressor <prot>  p53 </prot>  .
 <prot> p53 </prot>  is a nuclear protein that regulates gene expression via sequence - specific DNA binding and / or direct protein - protein interaction .
We found that the human <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  TR subtype beta 1 </prot>  </p1>  ( <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  h - TR beta 1 </prot>  </p1>  ) physically interacted with <p2  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  p53 </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  via its DNA binding domain .
As a result of this physical interaction , binding of <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  h - TR beta 1 </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  </p1>  to its hormone response elements either as homodimer or as a heterodimer with the <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  retinoic X receptor </prot>  </p2>  was inhibited by <prot>  p53 </prot>  in a concentration - dependent manner .
In transfected cells , wild - type <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  p53 </prot>  </p1>  repressed the hormone - dependent transcriptional activation of <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  h - TR beta 1 </prot>  </p2>  .
In contrast , mutant <prot>  p53 </prot>  either had no effect or activated the transcriptional activity of <prot>  h - TR beta 1 </prot>  depending on the type of hormone response elements .
These results indicate the gene regulating activity of TRs was modulated by <prot>  p53 </prot>  , suggesting that the cross talk between these two transcriptional factors may play an important role in the biology of normal and cancer cells .

A protein , <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  sorting nexin - 1 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  ( <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  SNX1 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  ) , was identified in a human cell line that bound to a region of the <p2  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  epidermal growth factor receptor </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=3 >  <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  EGFR </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  ) containing the lysosomal targeting code .
 <prot> SNX1 </prot>  contains a region of homology to a yeast vacuolar sorting protein , and overexpression of <prot>  SNX1 </prot>  decreased the amount of <prot>  EGFR </prot>  on the cell surface as a result of enhanced rates of constitutive and ligand - induced degradation .
Thus , <prot>  SNX1 </prot>  is likely to play a role in sorting <prot>  EGFR </prot>  to lysosomes .

TI - The splicing factor <prot>  U2AF35 </prot>  mediates critical protein - protein interactions in constitutive and enhancer - dependent splicing .
PG - 1356 - 68 AB - The splicing factor U2AF ( U2 snRNP auxiliary factor ) is a heterodimer with subunits of 65 and 35 kD ( <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  U2AF65 </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  U2AF35 </prot>  </p2>  ) .
 <prot> U2AF65 </prot>  binds specifically to 3 ' splice sites , but previous studies failed to demonstrate a function for <prot>  U2AF35 </prot>  .
Here , we report that <prot>  U2AF35 </prot>  is required for constitutive splicing and also functions as a mediator of enhancer - dependent splicing .
Nuclear extracts deficient in <prot>  U2AF35 </prot>  were inactive ; however , both constitutive and enhancer - dependent splicing could be restored by the addition of purified recombinant <prot>  U2AF35 </prot>  .
In vitro protein - RNA interaction studies with pre - mRNAs containing either a constitutive or regulated splicing enhancer revealed that <prot>  U2AF35 </prot>  directly mediates interactions between <prot>  U2AF65 </prot>  and proteins bound to the enhancers .
Thus , <prot>  U2AF35 </prot>  functions as a bridge between <prot>  U2AF65 </prot>  and the enhancer complex to recruit <prot>  U2AF65 </prot>  to the adjacent intron .

PG - 2157 - 67 AB - The human basal transcription factor <prot>  TFIIH </prot>  plays a central role in two distinct processes .
 <prot> TFIIH </prot>  is an obligatory component of the RNA polymerase II ( RNAP II ) transcription initiation complex .
Additionally , it is believed to be the core structure around which some if not all the components of the nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) machinery assemble to constitute a nucleotide excision repairosome .
At least two of the subunits of <prot>  TFIIH </prot>  ( <prot>  XPB </prot>  and <prot>  XPD </prot>  proteins ) are implicated in the disease xeroderma pigmentosum ( XP ) .
We have exploited the availability of the cloned <prot>  XPB </prot>  , <prot>  XPD </prot>  , <prot>  p62 </prot>  , <prot>  p44 </prot>  , and <prot>  p34 </prot>  genes ( all of which encode polypeptide subunits of <prot>  TFIIH </prot>  ) to examine interactions between in vitro - translated polypeptides by co - immunoprecipitation .
Additionally we have examined interactions between <prot>  TFIIH </prot>  components , the human NER protein <prot>  XPG </prot>  , and the <prot>  CSB </prot>  protein which is implicated in Cockayne syndrome ( CS ) .
Our analyses demonstrate that the <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  XPB </prot>  </p1>  , <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  XPD </prot>  </p2>  , <prot>  p44 </prot>  , and  <prot>  p62 </prot>  proteins interact with each other .

PG - 11971 - 8 AB - Residues in human <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  leukemia inhibitory factor </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  ( <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  hLIF </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  ) crucial for binding to both the human <p2  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  LIF receptor </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  ( R ) and <p2  pair=2 >  <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  gp130 </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  were identified by analysis of alanine scanning mutants of <prot>  hLIF </prot>  in assays for both receptor binding and bioactivity .
The region of <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  hLIF </prot>  </p1>  most important for binding to the <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  hLIF - R </prot>  </p2>  is composed of residues from the amino terminus of the D - helix , carboxyl terminus of the B - helix , and C - D loop .
This site forms a distinct surface at the end of the four - helix bundle in the tertiary structure of the closely related murine <prot>  LIF </prot>  .
The two residues of <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  hLIF </prot>  </p1>  that contribute the majority of free energy for <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  hLIF - R </prot>  </p2>  binding , Phe - 156 and Lys - 159 are surrounded by other residues which have only a moderate impact .
This arrangement of a few key residues surrounded by less important ones is analogous to the functional binding epitope of <prot>  human growth hormone </prot>  for its receptor .
A second region of <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  hLIF </prot>  </p1>  that includes residues from the carboxyl terminus of the D - helix and A - B loop also had a weak influence on <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  hLIF - R </prot>  </p2>  binding .
Residues in <p1  pair=8 >  <prot>  hLIF </prot>  </p1>  from both the A - and C - helices are involved in binding the <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  gp130 </prot>  </p2>  co - receptor .
Abolition of the <p1  pair=9 >  <prot>  gp130 </prot>  </p1>  binding site in <p2  pair=9 >  <prot>  hLIF </prot>  </p2>  created antagonists of <prot>  LIF </prot>  action .

PG - 13691 - 6 AB - <prot>  Calnexin </prot>  is an integral membrane protein that acts as a chaperone during glycoprotein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum .
Cross - linking studies were carried out with the aim of investigating the interactions of <prot>  calnexin </prot>  with glycoproteins in vitro .
A truncated version of the integral membrane glycoprotein <prot>  Glut 1 </prot>  ( <prot>  GT155 </prot>  ) was synthesized in a rabbit reticulocyte translation system in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomes .
Following immunoprecipitation with an anticalnexin antiserum , a cross - linker - independent association was observed between <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  GT155 </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  calnexin </prot>  </p2>  .
In addition , the anti - calnexin antiserum immunoprecipitated a UV - dependent cross - linking product consisting of <p1  pair=4 >  <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  GT155 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  and a protein of approximately 60 kDa designated <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  CAP - 60 </prot>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  calnexin - associated protein </prot>  </p2>  of 60 kDa ) .
Both the <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  GT155 </prot>  </p1>  - <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  calnexin </prot>  </p2>  and the <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  GT155 </prot>  </p1>  - <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  CAP - 60 </prot>  </p2>  interactions were dependent on the presence of a correctly modified oligosaccharide group on <prot>  GT155 </prot>  , a characteristic of many <prot>  calnexin </prot>  interactions .
A <prot>  GT155 </prot>  mutant that was not glycosylated ( AGGT155 ) did not associate with <prot>  calnexin </prot>  or <prot>  CAP - 60 </prot>  .
 <p1  pair=8 >  <prot> Calreticulin </prot>  </p1>  , the soluble homologue of <prot>  calnexin </prot>  , was also shown to interact with <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  GT155 </prot>  </p2>  only when the protein bore a correctly modified oligosaccharide group .
Thus , our data show that both <p1  pair=9 >  <prot>  calnexin </prot>  </p1>  and <p1  pair=10 >  <prot>  calreticulin </prot>  </p1>  interact with <p2  pair=10 >  <p2  pair=9 >  <prot>  Glut 1 </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  in a glycosylation - dependent manner .

TI - Identification of a critical ligand binding determinant of the human <prot>  <prot>  erythropoietin </prot>  receptor </prot>  .
Evidence for common ligand binding motifs in the cytokine receptor family .
PG - 14045 - 54 AB - The <prot>  <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  erythropoietin </prot>  </p1>  receptor </prot>  ( <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  EPOR </prot>  </p2>  ) is a member of a family of cytokine and growth factor receptors that share conserved features in their extracellular and cytoplasmic domains .
We have used site - specific mutagenesis within the extracellular domain of the <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  EPOR </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  to search for amino acid residues involved in <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  erythropoietin </prot>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  EPO </prot>  </p2>  ) binding .
Mutant proteins were expressed in bacteria as soluble <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  EPO </prot>  </p1>  binding proteins ( <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  EBP </prot>  </p2>  ) and characterized for <prot>  EPO </prot>  binding activity in a number of different assays .
Substitution of phenylalanine at position 93 ( Phe93 ) with alanine ( F93A mutation ) resulted in a drastic reduction in <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  EPO </prot>  </p1>  binding in the <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  EBP </prot>  </p2>  .
More conservative tyrosine or tryptophan substitutions at Phe93 resulted in much less dramatic effects on <prot>  EPO </prot>  binding .
Biophysical studies indicated that the F93A mutation does not result in gross structural alterations in the <prot>  EBP </prot>  .
Furthermore , the F93A mutation in full - length <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  EPOR </prot>  </p1>  expressed in COS cells abolished detectable <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  EPO </prot>  </p2>  binding .
This was not a result of processing or transport defects , since mutant receptor was present on the surface of the cells .
Mutations in the region immediately around Phe93 and in residues homologous to other reported ligand binding determinants of the cytokine receptor family had small to moderate effects on <prot>  EPO </prot>  binding .
These data indicate that Phe93 is a critical <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  EPO </prot>  </p1>  binding determinant of the <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  EPOR </prot>  </p2>  .
Furthermore , since Phe93 aligns with critical ligand binding determinants in other receptors of the cytokine receptor family , these data suggest that receptors of this family may use common structural motifs to bind their cognate ligands .

PG - 16921 - 6 AB - <prot>  Interleukin - 13 </prot>  ( <prot>  IL - 13 </prot>  ) is a cytokine secreted by activated T lymphocytes that shares many , but not all , biological activities with <prot>  IL - 4 </prot>  .
These overlapping activities are probably due to the existence of common receptor components .
Two proteins have been described as constituents of the <prot>  IL - 4 </prot>  receptor , a approximately 140 - kDa glycoprotein ( <prot>  IL - 4R </prot>  ) and the gamma chain ( gammac ) of the <prot>  <prot>  IL - 2 </prot>  receptor </prot>  , but neither of these proteins binds <prot>  IL - 13 </prot>  .

TI - Two - hybrid system as a model to study the interaction of beta - amyloid peptide monomers .
PG - 2065 - 70 AB - The kinetics of amyloid fibril formation by <prot>  beta - amyloid peptide </prot>  ( <prot>  Abeta </prot>  ) are typical of a nucleation - dependent polymerization mechanism .
This type of mechanism suggests that the study of the interaction of <prot>  Abeta </prot>  with itself can provide some valuable insights into Alzheimer disease amyloidosis .
Interaction of <p1  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  Abeta </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  with itself was explored with the yeast two - hybrid system .
Fusion proteins were created by linking the <prot>  Abeta </prot>  fragment to a <prot>  LexA </prot>  DNA - binding domain ( bait ) and also to a <prot>  B42 </prot>  transactivation domain ( prey ) .
Protein - protein interactions were measured by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae harboring <prot>  lacZ </prot>  ( <prot>  beta - galactosidase </prot>  ) and <prot>  LEU2 </prot>  ( <prot>  leucine utilization </prot>  ) genes under the control of LexA - dependent operators .
This approach suggests that the <p1  pair=2 >  <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  Abeta </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  molecule is capable of interacting with itself in vivo in the yeast cell nucleus .
 <prot> LexA </prot>  protein fused to the Drosophila protein <prot>  bicoid </prot>  ( <prot>  LexA </prot>  - <prot>  bicoid </prot>  ) failed to interact with the <prot>  B42 </prot>  fragment fused to <prot>  Abeta </prot>  , indicating that the observed <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  Abeta </prot>  </p1>  - <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  Abeta </prot>  </p2>  interaction was specific .
Specificity was further shown by the finding that no significant interaction was observed in yeast expressing <prot>  LexA </prot>  - <prot>  Abeta </prot>  bait when the <prot>  B42 </prot>  transactivation domain was fused to an <prot>  Abeta </prot>  fragment with Phe - Phe at residues 19 and 20 replaced by Thr - Thr ( AbetaTT ) , a finding that is consistent with in vitro observations made by others .
Moreover , when a peptide fragment bearing this substitution was mixed with native <prot>  Abeta </prot>  - ( 1 - 40 ) , it inhibited formation of fibrils in vitro as examined by electron microscopy .
The findings presented in this paper suggest that the two - hybrid system can be used to study the interaction of <prot>  Abeta </prot>  monomers and to define the peptide sequences that may be important in nucleation - dependent aggregation .

Monomeric ( <prot>  IL - 6M </prot>  ) and dimeric ( <p1  pair=5 >  <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  IL - 6D </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  ) forms of Escherichia coli - derived human <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  and the extracellular ( AMPPPP quot ; soluble AMPPPP quot ; ) portions of the <prot>  <p1  pair=11 >  <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  </p1>  receptor </prot>  ( <p2  pair=11 >  <prot>  sIL - 6R </prot>  </p2>  ) and <prot>  gp130 </prot>  have been purified in order to investigate the effect of <p1  pair=6 >  <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  dimerization on binding to the receptor complex .
Although <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  IL - 6D </prot>  </p1>  has a higher binding affinity for immobilized <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  sIL - 6R </prot>  </p2>  , as determined by biosensor analysis employing surface plasmon resonance detection , <prot>  IL - 6M </prot>  is more potent than <prot>  IL - 6D </prot>  in a STAT3 phosphorylation assay .
The difference in potency is significantly less pronounced when measured in the murine 7TD1 hybridoma growth factor assay and the human hepatoma HepG2 bioassay due to time - dependent dissociation at 37 ? C of <p1  pair=8 >  <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  dimers into active monomers .
The increased binding affinity of <p1  pair=9 >  <prot>  IL - 6D </prot>  </p1>  appears to be due to its ability to cross - link two <p2  pair=9 >  <prot>  sIL - 6R </prot>  </p2>  molecules on the biosensor surface .
Studies of the <p1  pair=10 >  <p2  pair=10 >  <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  ternary complex formation demonstrated that the reduced biological potency of <prot>  IL - 6D </prot>  resulted from a decreased ability of the <p1  pair=12 >  <prot>  IL - 6D </prot>  </p1>  ( <p2  pair=12 >  <prot>  sIL - 6R </prot>  </p2>  ) 2 complex to couple with the soluble portion of <prot>  gp130 </prot>  .
These data imply that <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  - induced dimerization of <prot>  sIL - 6R </prot>  is not the driving force in promoting formation of the hexameric ( <p1  pair=13 >  <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  </p1>  <p2  pair=13 >  <prot>  IL - 6R </prot>  </p2>  <prot>  gp130 </prot>  ) 2 complex .
A model is presented whereby the trimeric complex of <p1  pair=14 >  <prot>  IL - 6R </prot>  </p1>  , <p2  pair=14 >  <prot>  gp130 </prot>  </p2>  , and <prot>  IL - 6M </prot> forms before the functional hexamer .
Due to its increased affinity for the <p1  pair=16 >  <prot>  IL - 6 R </prot>  </p1>  but its decreased ability to couple with <p1  pair=17 >  <prot>  gp130 </prot>  </p1>  , we suggest that a stable <p1  pair=15 >  <p2  pair=15 >  <p2  pair=16 >  <p2  pair=17 >  <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  </p2>  </p1>  dimer may be an efficient <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  antagonist .

TI - Physical interaction of mammalian <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  CDC37 </prot>  </p1>  with <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  CDK4 </prot>  </p2>  PG - 22030 - 4 AB - <prot>  CDC37 </prot>  was originally identified as a Start gene in budding yeast and has been shown to be required for association of <prot>  CDC28 </prot>  with cyclins .
The exact functional mechanism by which <prot>  CDC37 </prot>  promotes this association , however , remains unknown .
 <prot> CDK4 </prot>  is a <prot>  cyclin D - dependent kinase </prot>  that controls progression through G1 of the mammalian cell cycle .
We have detected a specific association of <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  CDK4 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  with the molecular chaperon <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  HSP90 </prot>  </p2>  and a 44 - kDa protein that we identify as mammalian <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  CDC37 </prot>  </p2>  .
A physical interaction between <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  CDC37 </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  CDK4 </prot>  </p2>  suggests that <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  CDC37 </prot>  </p1>  may regulate the mammalian cell cycle through a direct effect on <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  CDK4 </prot>  </p2>  .
Association of <p1  pair=6 >  <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  CDK4 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  with both <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  CDC37 </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  HSP90 </prot>  </p2>  may also imply a mechanistic link between the functions of <prot>  CDC37 </prot>  and <prot>  HSP90 </prot>  .

TI - Interactions of <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  p60 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  , a mediator of <prot>  progesterone receptor </prot>  assembly , with heat shock proteins <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  hsp90 </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  hsp70 </prot>  </p2>  .
PG - 682 - 93 AB - Previous studies on the assembly of <prot>  progesterone receptor </prot>  ( <prot>  PR </prot>  ) complexes in vitro have suggested that <prot>  PR </prot>  assembly is a dynamic , ordered process involving at least eight nonreceptor proteins .
One of these proteins , <prot>  p60 </prot>  , appears transiently during assembly and is not a component of functionally mature <prot>  PR </prot>  complexes .
In the present study we observe that a monoclonal antibody specific for <prot>  p60 </prot>  can , on the one hand , inhibit formation of mature <prot>  PR </prot>  complexes containing <prot>  heat shock protein 90 </prot>  ( <prot>  hsp90 </prot>  ) , <prot>  p23 </prot>  , and immunophilins and , on the other , enhance recovery of early <prot>  PR </prot>  complexes containing <prot>  hsp70 </prot>  and <prot>  Hip </prot>  ( <prot>  p48 </prot>  ) .
This observation supports a model in which <prot>  p60 </prot>  functions at an intermediate stage of <prot>  PR </prot>  assembly to facilitate formation of subsequent <prot>  PR </prot>  complexes lacking <prot>  p60 </prot>  .
Since <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  p60 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  is typically found in a complex with <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  hsp90 </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  hsp70 </prot>  </p2>  , we have further characterized its interactions with these proteins .
 <p1  pair=5 >  <p1  pair=6 >  <prot> P60 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  can bind either <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  hsp70 </prot>  </p2>  or <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  hsp90 </prot>  </p2>  independently and in an ATP - independent manner .
Since <prot>  hsp90 </prot>  and <prot>  hsp70 </prot>  do not readily associate on their own , it appears that <prot>  p60 </prot>  is the central organizing component of an <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  hsp90 </prot>  </p1>  - <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  p60 </prot>  </p2>  - <prot>  hsp70 </prot>  complex .
Mutational analysis of <p1  pair=10 >  <p1  pair=8 >  <p1  pair=9 >  <prot>  p60 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  indicates that the N terminus is required for <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  hsp70 </prot>  </p2>  binding , and a central region containing tetratricopeptide repeat motifs is necessary for binding <p2  pair=9 >  <prot>  hsp90 </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=10 >  <prot>  hsp70 </prot>  </p2>  .
The <p1  pair=11 >  <prot>  hsp90 </prot>  </p1>  - <p2  pair=11 >  <prot>  p60 </prot>  </p2>  -  <prot>  hsp70 </prot>  multichaperone complex is highly dynamic and does not appear to be affected by the <prot>  hsp90 </prot>  - binding drug geldanamycin .
The interactions of <p1  pair=12 >  <prot>  hsp70 </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=12 >  <prot>  hsp90 </prot>  </p2>  in intermediate <prot>  PR </prot>  complexes are shown to be distinct from their separate interactions in early <prot>  PR </prot>  complexes ( <prot>  hsp70 </prot>  ) or in mature <prot>  PR </prot>  complexes ( hsp90 ) .
From these results , it appears that <prot>  p60 </prot>  is a key mediator in the chaperoned assembly and functional maturation of <prot>  PR </prot>  complexes .

TI - Genetic characterization of a mammalian protein - protein interaction domain by using a yeast reverse two - hybrid system .
PG - 10321 - 6 AB - Many biological processes rely upon protein - protein interactions .
Hence , detailed analysis of these interactions is critical for their understanding .
Due to the complexities involved , genetic approaches are often needed .
In yeast and phage , genetic characterizations of protein complexes are possible .
However , in multicellular organisms , such characterizations are limited by the lack of powerful selection systems .
Herein we describe genetic selections that allow single amino acid changes that disrupt protein - protein interactions to be selected from large libraries of randomly generated mutant alleles .
The strategy , based on a yeast reverse two - hybrid system , involves a first - step negative selection for mutations that affect interaction , followed by a second - step positive selection for a subset of these mutations that maintain expression of full - length protein ( two - step selection ) .
We have selected such mutations in the transcription factor <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  E2F1 </prot>  </p1>  that affect its ability to heterodimerize with <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  DP1 </prot>  </p2>  .
The mutations obtained identified a putative helix in the marked box , a region conserved among E2F family members , as an important determinant for interaction .
This two - step selection procedure can be used to characterize any interaction domain that can be tested in the two - hybrid system .

TI - Formation of <prot>  p27 </prot>  - CDK complexes during the human mitotic cell cycle .
PG - 135 - 46 AB - In eukaryotic cells , the coordinated activation of different cyclin - dependent kinases regulates entry into S - phase .
In vitro and in nonproliferating cells , <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  p27 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  associates with and inhibits cyclin / cycin - dependent kinase ( CDK ) holoenzymes containing either <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  CDK4 </prot>  </p2>  , <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  CDK6 </prot>  </p2>  , or <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  CDK2 </prot>  </p2>  .
Although many different types of proliferating cells contain <prot>  p27 </prot>  protein , neither the interactions of <prot>  p27 </prot>  with cyclin / CDK complexes nor the consequences of this interaction during the mitotic cycle have been fully explored .
We report that , in MANCA cells , the amount of <prot>  p27 </prot>  is constant during the cell cycle .
In addition , <p1  pair=5 >  <p1  pair=6 >  <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  p27 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  associates with three different CDKs : <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  CDK2 </prot>  </p2>  , <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  CDK4 </prot>  </p2>  , and <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  CDK6 </prot>  </p2>  .
Furthermore , the amount of <prot>  p27 </prot>  is significantly lower than the amount of <prot>  cyclin D3 </prot>  in these cells .
The amount of <p1  pair=8 >  <prot>  CDK4 </prot>  </p1>  and <p1  pair=9 >  <prot>  CDK6 </prot>  </p1>  associated with <p2  pair=8 >  <p2  pair=9 >  <prot>  p27 </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  does not change in a cell cycle - dependent fashion ; in contrast , the amount of <p1  pair=10 >  <prot>  CDK2 </prot>  </p1>  associated with <p2  pair=10 >  <prot>  p27 </prot>  </p2>  is lowest in early G1 cells and increases to a maximum in mid - G1 phase , reaching a steady - state level in late G1 - phase cells .
After mid - G1 phase , the amount of each <prot>  p27 </prot>  / CDK complex remains constant through the remainder of the cell cycle .
 <prot> p27 </prot>  - immunoprecipitates contain an Rb - kinase activity .
The substrate specificity , the expression pattern of this kinase , and the ability to deplete 50 % of this kinase activity with a <prot>  CDK6 </prot>  - specific antibody suggest that the <prot>  CDK6 </prot>  protein mediates , in part , the <prot>  p27 </prot>  - associated <prot>  Rb </prot>  - kinase activity .
In contrast , <p1  pair=11 >  <prot>  p27 </prot>  </p1>  complexes containing <p2  pair=11 >  <prot>  CDK2 </prot>  </p2>  are incapable of phosphorylating <prot>  histone H1 </prot>  .
These data are consistent with a model wherein <prot>  cyclin D </prot>  / CDK complexes sequester the <prot>  CDK2 </prot>  - dependent kinase inhibitory activity of <prot>  p27 </prot>  .

PG - 26356 - 61 AB - The growth - promoting effects of <prot>  gastrin </prot>  on normal and neoplastic gastrointestinal tissues have been shown to be mediated by the <prot>  gastrin </prot>  / <prot>  CCKB receptor </prot>  , which belongs to the family of G protein - coupled receptors .
However , the downstream signaling pathways activated by <prot>  gastrin </prot>  are not well characterized .
In the present study , we demonstrate that <p1  pair=4 >  <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  gastrin </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  <prot>  insulin </prot>  receptor substrate 1 </prot>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  IRS - 1 </prot>  </p2>  ) , the major cytoplasmic substrate of the <prot>  <prot>  insulin </prot>  receptor </prot>  .
The <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  gastrin </prot>  </p1>  - induced phosphorylation of <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  IRS - 1 </prot>  </p2>  was rapid and transient , occurring within 30 s of treatment and diminishing thereafter .
 <prot> IRS - 1 </prot>  binds several proteins containing Src homology 2 domains through its multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites .
Following <prot>  gastrin </prot>  stimulation , we observed a time - and dose - dependent association of <p1  pair=7 >  <p1  pair=8 >  <prot>  IRS - 1 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  with the <prot>  p85 </prot>  regulatory subunit of <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase </prot>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  PI 3 - kinase </prot>  </p2>  ) .
In addition , activation of <prot>  PI 3 - kinase </prot>  was detected in anti - <prot>  IRS - 1 </prot>  immunoprecipitates from <prot>  gastrin </prot>  - treated cells , suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of <prot>  IRS - 1 </prot>  , which leads to the rapid recruitment of <prot>  p85 </prot>  , might be one mechanism used by <prot>  gastrin </prot>  to activate <prot>  PI 3 - kinase </prot>  .
We have previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of <p1  pair=12 >  <p1  pair=9 >  <prot>  Shc </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  and its association with the <p1  pair=10 >  <p2  pair=9 >  <prot>  Grb2 </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  - <p2  pair=10 >  <p2  pair=12 >  <prot>  Sos </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  complex may contribute to the activation of the <prot>  mitogen - activated protein kinase </prot>  pathway by <prot>  gastrin </prot>  .
We report here that <p1  pair=11 >  <prot>  Grb2 </prot>  </p1>  also interacts with tyrosine - phosphorylated <p2  pair=11 >  <prot>  IRS - 1 </prot>  </p2>  in response to <prot>  gastrin </prot>  .
Taken together , our results suggest that <prot>  IRS - 1 </prot>  may serve as a converging target in the signaling pathways stimulated by receptors that belong to different families , such as the <prot>  gastrin </prot>  / <prot>  <prot>  CCKB </prot>  G protein - coupled receptor </prot>  and the <prot>  <prot>  insulin </prot>  receptor </prot>  .

In the yeast - based cloning system , the only strong interaction that was detected between <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  GAP - 43 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  and the <prot>  calcium effector protein </prot>  , <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  calmodulin </prot>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  CaM </prot>  </p2>  ) .
 <p1  pair=3 >  <prot> PKC </prot>  </p1>  phosphorylates <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  GAP - 43 </prot>  </p2>  on serine 41 .
When we changed this serine to an aspartate residue to mimic constitutive phosphorylation , the interaction with <prot>  CaM </prot>  was blocked .
Surprisingly , the N - terminal third of <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  GAP - 43 </prot>  </p1>  alone bound <p1  pair=5 >  <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  CaM </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  more strongly than did intact <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  GAP - 43 </prot>  </p2>  , suggesting that the protein 's C - terminus may play a role in modulating the interaction with <prot>  CaM </prot>  .
These results , along with other recent findings , suggest a novel role for the interaction between <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  GAP - 43 </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  CaM </prot>  </p2>  .

PG - 1001 - 5 AB - Mutations in the <prot>  p53 </prot>  tumor suppressor are among the most frequently observed genetic alterations in human cancer and map to the 200 - amino acid core domain of the protein .
The core domain contains the sequence - specific DNA binding activity and the in vitro <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  53BP2 </prot>  </p1>  protein binding activity of <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  p53 </prot>  </p2>  .
The crystal structure of the <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  p53 </prot>  </p1>  core domain bound to the <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  53BP2 </prot>  </p2>  protein , which contains an SH3 ( Src homology 3 ) domain and four ankyrin repeats , revealed that ( i ) the SH3 domain binds the L3 loop of <prot>  p53 </prot>  in a manner distinct from that of previously characterized SH3 - polyproline peptide complexes , and ( ii ) an ankyrin repeat , which forms an L - shaped structure consisting of a beta hairpin and two alpha helices , binds the L2 loop of <prot>  p53 </prot>  .
The structure of the complex shows that the <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  53BP2 </prot>  </p1>  binding site on the <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  p53 </prot>  </p2>  core domain consists of evolutionarily conserved regions that are frequently mutated in cancer and that it overlaps the site of DNA binding .

PG - 948 - 53 AB - The <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  MDM2 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  oncoprotein is a cellular inhibitor of the <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  p53 </prot>  </p2>  tumor suppressor in that it can bind the transactivation domain of <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  p53 </prot>  </p2>  and downregulate its ability to activate transcription .
In certain cancers , <prot>  MDM2 </prot>  amplification is a common event and contributes to the inactivation of <prot>  p53 </prot>  .
The crystal structure of the 109 - residue amino - terminal domain of <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  MDM2 </prot>  </p1>  bound to a 15 - residue transactivation domain peptide of <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  p53 </prot>  </p2>  revealed that <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  MDM2 </prot>  </p1>  has a deep hydrophobic cleft on which the <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  p53 </prot>  </p2>  peptide binds as an amphipathic alpha helix .
The interface relies on the steric complementarity between the <prot>  MDM2 </prot>  cleft and the hydrophobic face of the <prot>  p53 </prot>  alpha helix and , in particular , on a triad of <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  p53 </prot>  </p1>  amino acids - Phe19 , Trp23 , and Leu26 - which insert deep into the <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  MDM2 </prot>  </p2>  cleft .
These same <prot>  p53 </prot>  residues are also involved in transactivation , supporting the hypothesis that <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  MDM2 </prot>  </p1>  inactivates <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  p53 </prot>  </p2>  by concealing its transactivation domain .
The structure also suggests that the amphipathic alpha helix may be a common structural motif in the binding of a diverse family of transactivation factors to the <prot>  TATA - binding protein </prot>  - associated factors .

In the baculovirus coexpression system , <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  </p1>  was activated by <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  JAK2 </prot>  </p2>  in the presence of <prot>  p21ras </prot>  .
Under these conditions , a ternary complex of <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  p21ras </prot>  </p1>  , <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  JAK2 </prot>  </p2>  , and  <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  was observed .
In contrast , in the absence of <prot>  p21ras </prot>  , coexpression of <prot>  JAK2 </prot>  and <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  resulted in an overall decrease in the <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  kinase activity .

TI - <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  CD4 </prot>  </p1>  - induced interaction of primary HIV - 1 <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  gp120 </prot>  </p2>  glycoproteins with the chemokine receptor <prot>  CCR - 5 </prot>  .
PG - 179 - 83 AB - For efficient entry into target cells , primary macrophage - tropic and laboratory - adapted human immunodeficiency viruses type 1 ( HIV - 1 ) require particular chemokine receptors , <prot>  CCR - 5 </prot>  and <prot>  CXCR - 4 </prot>  , respectively , as well as the primary receptor <prot>  CD4 </prot>  ( refs 1 - 6 ) .
Here we show that a complex of <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  gp120 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  , the exterior envelope glycoprotein , of macrophage - tropic primary HIV - 1 and soluble <p1  pair=4 >  <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  CD4 </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  interacts specifically with <p2  pair=3 >  <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  CCR - 5 </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  and inhibits the binding of the natural <prot>  CCR - 5 </prot>  ligands , <prot>  macrophage inflammatory protein ( MIP ) - 1alpha </prot>  and <prot>  MIP - 1beta </prot>  ( refs 7 , 8 ) .
The apparent affinity of the interaction between <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  gp120 </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  CCR - 5 </prot>  </p2>  was dramatically lower in the absence of soluble <prot>  CD4 </prot>  .
Additionally , in the absence of <prot>  gp120 </prot>  , an interaction between a two - domain <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  CD4 </prot>  </p1>  fragment and <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  CCR - 5 </prot>  </p2>  was observed .
A <p1  pair=7 >  <p1  pair=8 >  <prot>  gp120 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  fragment retaining the <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  CD4 </prot>  </p2>  - binding site and overlapping epitopes was able to interact with <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  CCR - 5 </prot>  </p2>  only if the V3 loop , which can specify HIV - 1 tropism and chemokine receptor choice , was also present on the molecule .
Neutralizing antibodies directed against either <prot>  CD4 </prot>  - induced or V3 epitopes on <prot>  gp120 </prot>  blocked the interaction of <p1  pair=10 >  <p1  pair=9 >  <prot>  gp12O </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  - <p1  pair=11 >  <p2  pair=9 >  <prot>  CD4 </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  complexes with <p2  pair=10 >  <p2  pair=11 >  <prot>  CCR - 5 </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  .
These results suggest that HIV - 1 attachment to <prot>  CD4 </prot>  creates a high - affinity binding site for <prot>  CCR - 5 </prot>  , leading to membrane fusion and virus entry .

TI - <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  Stat3 </prot>  </p1>  recruitment by two distinct ligand - induced , tyrosine - phosphorylated docking sites in the <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  <prot>  interleukin - 10 </prot>  receptor </prot>  </p2>  intracellular domain .
PG - 27954 - 61 AB - Recent work has shown that <prot>  IL - 10 </prot>  induces activation of the JAK - STAT signaling pathway .
To define the mechanism underlying signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) protein recruitment to the <prot>  <prot>  interleukin 10 </prot>  ( <prot>  IL - 10 </prot>  ) receptor </prot>  , the STAT proteins activated by <prot>  IL - 10 </prot>  in different cell populations were first defined using electrophoretic mobility shift assays .
In all cells tested , <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  IL - 10 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  activated <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  Stat1 </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  Stat3 </prot>  </p2>  and induced the formation of three distinct DNA binding complexes that contained different combinations of these two transcription factors .
 <p1  pair=4 >  <prot> IL - 10 </prot>  </p1>  also activated <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  Stat5 </prot>  </p2>  in Ba / F3 cells that stably expressed the murine <prot>  <prot>  IL - 10 </prot>  receptor </prot>  .
Using a structure - function mutagenesis approach , two tyrosine residues ( Tyr427 and Tyr477 ) in the intracellular domain of the murine <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  <prot>  IL - 10 </prot>  receptor </prot>  </p1>  were found to be redundantly required for receptor function and for activation of <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  Stat3 </prot>  </p2>  but not for <prot>  Stat1 </prot>  or Stat5 .
Twelve amino acid peptides encompassing either of these two tyrosine residues in phosphorylated form coprecipitated <prot>  Stat3 </prot>  but not <prot>  Stat1 </prot>  and blocked <prot>  IL - 10 </prot>  - induced <prot>  Stat3 </prot>  phosphorylation in a cell - free system .
In contrast , tyrosine - phosphorylated peptides containing Tyr374 or Tyr396 did not interact with <prot>  Stat3 </prot>  or block <prot>  Stat3 </prot>  activation .
These data demonstrate that <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  Stat3 </prot>  </p1>  but not <prot>  Stat1 </prot>  or <prot>  Stat5 </prot>  is directly recruited to the ligand - activated <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  <prot>  IL - 10 </prot>  receptor </prot>  </p2>  by binding to specific but redundant receptor intracellular domain sequences containing phosphotyrosine .
This study thus supports the concept that utilization of distinct STAT proteins by different cytokine receptors is dependent on the expression of particular ligand - activatable , tyrosine - containing STAT docking sites in receptor intracellular domains .

The protein has 76 % homology to murine <prot>  IL - 13Ralpha </prot>  , with 95 % amino acid identity in the cytoplasmic domain .
Only weak <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  IL - 13 </prot>  </p1>  binding activity was found in cells transfected with only <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  IL - 13Ralpha </prot>  </p2>  ; however , the combination of both <prot>  IL - 13Ralpha </prot>  and <prot>  IL - 4Ralpha </prot>  resulted in substantial binding activity , with a Kd of approximately 400 pM , indicating that both chains are essential components of the <prot>  <prot>  IL - 13 </prot>  receptor </prot>  .
Whereas <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  IL - 13Ralpha </prot>  </p1>  serves as an alternative accessory protein to the common <prot>  cytokine receptor gamma chain </prot>  ( <prot>  gammac </prot>  ) for <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  IL - 4 </prot>  </p2>  signaling , it could not replace the function of <prot>  gammac </prot>  in allowing enhanced <prot>  IL - 2 </prot>  binding activity .
Nevertheless , the overall size and length of the cytoplasmic domain of <prot>  IL - 13Ralpha </prot>  and <prot>  gammac </prot>  are similar , and like <prot>  gammac </prot>  , <prot>  IL - 13Ralpha </prot>  is located on chromosome X .

In contrast , in cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) , <prot>  A beta </prot>  is found in a soluble form .
The analysis of complexes of <prot>  A beta </prot>  with CSF proteins in a KBr gradient revealed an association of <prot>  A beta </prot>  only with free proteins and not with lipoprotein particles .
 <p1  pair=2 >  <prot> Transthyretin </prot>  </p1>  ( <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  TTR </prot>  </p1>  ) , a second major CSF protein , formed SDS - stable complexes with <p2  pair=2 >  <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  A beta </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  and significantly decreased the rate of <prot>  A beta </prot>  fibril formation .
In physiological buffers and CSF , <prot>  TTR </prot>  exclusively decreased the level of <p1  pair=4 >  <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  A beta </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  pentamers .
Endogenous <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  TTR </prot>  </p1>  - <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  A beta </prot>  </p2>  complexes were detected in human CSF by immunoprecipitation .
Using site - directed mutagenesis and computer - assisted modelling , we identified amino acid residues on the surface of the <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  TTR </prot>  </p1>  monomer that interact with <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  A beta </prot>  </p2>  .
Specific <prot>  TTR </prot>  immunoreactivity was detected in multiple cortical neurons and astrocytes in the human brain .
We propose that <prot>  A beta </prot>  binding proteins play a key role in the modulation of <prot>  A beta </prot>  aggregation and normally prevent amyloid formation in biological fluids and in the brain .

PG - 2903 - 11 AB - The sterol regulatory element binding proteins ( <prot>  SREBP - 1 </prot>  and - 2 ) activate transcription of genes whose products are involved in the cellular uptake and synthesis of cholesterol .
Although considerable effort has been exerted to define the events regulating the levels of active SREBP , little is known about the transcriptional cofactors mediating SREBP function .
In an unbiased search for potential coactivators of SREBP , we isolated a protein of 265 kD from HeLa cells that directly bound <prot>  SREBP - 1 </prot>  and <prot>  SREBP - 2 </prot>  .
Peptide sequencing and Western blot analysis established that the 265 - kD protein was <prot>  CBP </prot>  ( <prot>  CREB - binding protein </prot>  ) a recently identified transcriptional coactivator .
The putative activation domain of SREBP was shown to bind specifically to amino - terminal domains of recombinant <prot>  CBP </prot>  and <prot>  p300 </prot>  ( a <prot>  CBP </prot>  - related protein ) .
Moreover , transfection studies demonstrated that <prot>  CBP </prot>  enhances the ability of SREBP to activate transcription of reporter genes in HeLa cells .
Together , these data suggest that <prot>  CBP </prot>  mediates SREBP transcriptional activity , thus revealing a new step in the biochemical pathway regulating cholesterol metabolism .

PG - 2067 - 76 AB - Hemopoietic cell proliferation is mediated by non - tyrosine and tyrosine kinases that signal via uncommon and common sets of downstream effector molecules including the <prot>  Grb2 </prot>  / <prot>  c - Cbl </prot>  .
In the present study we evaluated tyrosine phosphorylation of <prot>  c - Cbl </prot>  and the interaction of the <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  Grb2 </prot>  </p1>  / <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  c - Cbl </prot>  </p2>  complex with signaling proteins upon activation of non - tyrosine ( <prot>  c - Mpl </prot>  ) and tyrosine kinase ( <prot>  c - Kit </prot>  ) receptors leading to myeloid cell proliferation .
By using the growth factor dependent M - 07e cell line , we found that both <prot>  c - Mpl </prot>  and <prot>  c - Kit </prot>  ligands , namely : <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  SCF </prot>  </p1>  and <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  TPO </prot>  </p1>  , induce <p2  pair=3 >  <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  c - Cbl </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  tyrosine phosphorylation .
In these cells the adaptor protein <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  Grb2 </prot>  </p1>  constitutively binds a substantial fraction of <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  c - Cbl </prot>  </p2>  through the N - terminal SH3 domain .
In vitro experiments showed that the stable <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  Grb2 </prot>  </p1>  / <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  c - Cbl </prot>  </p2>  complex interacts , through the <p1  pair=8 >  <prot>  Grb2 </prot>  </p1>  SH2 domain , with the <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  SCF </prot>  </p1>  - activated <p2  pair=7 >  <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  c - Kit </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  .
By contrast stimulation with <prot>  TPO </prot>  leads to the formation of a <p1  pair=9 >  <prot>  Grb2 </prot>  </p1>  complex containing <p2  pair=9 >  <prot>  JAK2 </prot>  </p2>  .
In vitro and in vivo experiments support the hypothesis that <prot>  Grb2 </prot>  mediates the association of <p1  pair=10 >  <prot>  c - Kit </prot>  </p1>  with <p2  pair=10 >  <prot>  c - Cbl </prot>  </p2>  .
Moreover we found that , upon <prot>  SCF </prot>  stimulation , the <p1  pair=11 >  <prot>  Grb2 </prot>  </p1>  / <p2  pair=11 >  <prot>  c - Cbl </prot>  </p2>  complex recruits <p1  pair=12 >  <prot>  Shc </prot>  </p1>  , probably via <p2  pair=12 >  <prot>  Grb2 </prot>  </p2>  .
By contrast the <p1  pair=13 >  <prot>  Ras </prot>  </p1>  exchanger factor ( <p2  pair=13 >  <prot>  Sos1 </prot>  </p2>  ) was not detected in anti - <prot>  c - Cbl </prot>  immunoprecipitates suggesting that <prot>  Grb2 </prot>  / <prot>  Sos1 </prot>  and <prot>  Grb2 </prot>  / <prot>  c - Cbl </prot>  are present in different complexes .
Taken together our results demonstrate that <prot>  c - Cbl </prot>  plays an important role in coupling both tyrosine and non - tyrosine kinase receptors to downstream effector molecules and that different signaling molecules interact with <p1  pair=14 >  <prot>  Grb2 </prot>  </p1>  / <p2  pair=14 >  <prot>  c - Cbl </prot>  </p2>  complex when non - tyrosine or tyrosine kinase receptors are activated .

TI - Efficient interaction of HIV - 1 with purified dendritic cells via multiple chemokine coreceptors .
PG - 2433 - 8 AB - HIV - 1 actively replicates in dendritic cell ( DC ) - T cell cocultures , but it has been difficult to demonstrate substantial infection of purified mature DCs .
We now find that HIV - 1 begins reverse transcription much more efficiently in DCs than T cells , even though T cells have higher levels of <prot>  CD4 </prot>  and <prot>  gp120 </prot>  binding .
DCs isolated from skin or from blood precursors behave similarly .
Several M - tropic strains and the T - tropic strain IIIB enter DCs efficiently , as assessed by the progressive formation of the early products of reverse transcription after a 90 - min virus pulse at 37 degrees C .
However , few late gag - containing sequences are detected , so that active viral replication does not occur .
The formation of these early transcripts seems to follow entry of HIV - 1 , rather than binding of virions that contain viral DNA .
Early transcripts are scarce if DCs are exposed to virus on ice for 4 h , or for 90 min at 37 degrees C , conditions which allow virus binding .
Also the early transcripts once formed are insensitive to <prot>  trypsin </prot>  .
The entry of a M - tropic isolates is blocked by the chemokine <prot>  RANTES </prot>  , and the entry of IIIB by SDF - 1 .
 <p1  pair=1 >  <prot> RANTES </prot>  </p1>  interacts with <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  CCR5 </prot>  </p2>  and <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  SDF - 1 </prot>  </p1>  with <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  CXCR4 </prot>  </p2>  receptors .
Entry of M - tropic but not T - tropic virus is ablated in DCs from individuals who lack a functional <prot>  CCR5 </prot>  receptor .
DCs express more <prot>  CCR5 </prot>  and <prot>  CXCR4 </prot>  mRNA than T cells .
Therefore , while HIV - 1 does not replicate efficiently in mature DCs , viral entry can be active and can be blocked by chemokines that act on known receptors for M - and T - tropic virus .

Evidence toward a novel mechanism regulating muscle - specific gene expression .
PG - 2459 - 63 AB - We have used an interaction cloning strategy to identify an inhibitory isoform of the <prot>  ITF - 2 </prot>  transcription factor , <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  ITF - 2b </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  , that interacts with the transcriptional inhibitor <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  Id3 </prot>  </p2>  / <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  HLH462 </prot>  </p2>  .
The interaction was confirmed in vitro , and inside intact myogenic C2C12 cells .
As expected , overexpression of either <prot>  Id3 </prot>  / <prot>  HLH462 </prot>  or <prot>  ITF - 2b </prot>  effectively inhibited the activation of the muscle - specific <prot>  creatine kinase </prot>  promoter by the myogenic transcription factor <prot>  MyoD </prot>  .
However , when overexpressed simultaneously , <prot>  ITF - 2b </prot>  and Id3 / HLH462 counteracted each other 's inhibitory effect to produce a reduced overall inhibition .
Moreover , while <prot>  ITF - 2b </prot>  inhibited the <prot>  creatine kinase </prot>  promoter , it acted as a weak transactivator on an artificial promoter consisting of three tandem copies of the consensus myogenic factor DNA binding site .
Further investigation indicated that the <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  ITF - 2b </prot>  </p1>  / <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  MyoD </prot>  </p2>  heterodimer bound to its specific DNA binding site in vitro , and the DNA binding was effectively blocked by <prot>  Id3 </prot>  / <prot>  HLH462 </prot>  .
Additional analysis revealed the presence of transcripts for both the activating ( <prot>  ITF - 2a </prot>  ) and inhibitory ( <prot>  ITF - 2b </prot>  ) isoforms in differentiating C2C12 cultures , suggesting that both isoforms might participate in regulating the differentiation process .
Taken together , this study reveals a more complex pattern of regulatory interactions involving the helix - loop - helix proteins than was previously anticipated .

TI - <prot>  Bcl - x ( L ) </prot>  forms an ion channel in synthetic lipid membranes .
PG - 353 - 7 AB - <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  - related proteins are critical regulators of cell survival that are localized to the outer mitochondrial , outer nuclear and endoplasmic reticulum membranes .
Despite their physiological importance , the biochemical function of <prot>  Bcl - 2 </prot>  - related proteins has remained elusive .
The three - dimensional structure of <prot>  Bcl - xL </prot>  , an inhibitor of apoptosis , was recently shown to be similar to the structures of the pore - forming domains of bacterial toxins .
A key feature of these pore - forming domains is the ability to form ion channels in biological membranes .
Here we demonstrate that <prot>  Bcl - xL </prot>  shares this functional feature .
Like the bacterial toxins , <prot>  Bcl - xL </prot>  can insert into either synthetic lipid vesicles or planar lipid bilayers and form an ion - conducting channel .
This channel is pH - sensitive and becomes cation - selective at physiological pH .
The ion - conducting channel ( s ) formed by <prot>  Bcl - xL </prot>  display multiple conductance states that have identical ion selectivity .
Together , these data suggest that <prot>  Bcl - xL </prot>  may maintain cell survival by regulating the permeability of the intracellular membranes to which it is distributed .

The activity of NMDA ( N - methyl - D - aspartate ) receptors is mechanosensitive and dependent on the integrity of <prot>  actin </prot>  , suggesting a functionally important interaction between NMDA receptors and the postsynaptic cytoskeleton. <prot>  alpha - Actinin - 2 </prot>  , a member of the spectrin / <prot>  dystrophin </prot>  family of <prot>  actin </prot>  - binding proteins , is identified here as a brain postsynaptic density protein that colocalizes in dendritic spines with NMDA receptors and the putative NMDA receptor - clustering molecule <prot>  PSD - 95 </prot>  . <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  alpha - Actinin - 2 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  binds by its central rod domain to the cytoplasmic tail of both <prot>  NR1 </prot>  and <prot>  NR2B </prot>  subunits of the <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  NMDA receptor </prot>  </p2>  , and can be immunoprecipitated with NMDA receptors and <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  PSD - 95 </prot>  </p2>  from rat brain .

Microinjection of <prot>  HOX11 </prot>  into Xenopus oocytes arrested at the G2 phase of the cell cycle promoted progression to the M phase .
G2 arrest can be induced by gamma - irradiation , but is eliminated by expression of <prot>  HOX11 </prot>  within a T - cell line .
Thus <p1  pair=7 >  <p1  pair=8 >  <prot>  HOX11 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  is a cellular oncogene that targets <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  PP2A </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  PP1 </prot>  </p2>  , both of which are targets for oncogenic viruses and chemical tumour promoters .

PG - 1319 - 33 AB - The interaction between <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  interleukin - 6 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  ( <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  ) and <p2  pair=2 >  <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  </p1>  receptor </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=4 >  <p2  pair=5 >  <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  IL - 6R </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  </p2>  ) is the initial and most specific step in the <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  signaling pathway .
Understanding its mechanism at the amino acid level is the basis for developing small <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  - inhibiting molecules .
We studied the human <p1  pair=8 >  <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  </p1>  ( <p1  pair=9 >  <prot>  hIL - 6 </prot>  </p1>  ) / <p2  pair=8 >  <p2  pair=9 >  <prot>  hIL - 6R </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  binding interface by a combination of molecular modelling and site - directed mutagenesis .
Our model suggests that the center of the interface between the two molecules consists of hydrophobic contacts predicted to account for most of the binding - free energy .
These contacts can be regarded as a hydrophobic core shielded by hydrophilic residues that are also needed for recognition .
Following this hypothesis , we altered in <p1  pair=10 >  <prot>  hIL - 6 </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=10 >  <prot>  hIL - 6R </prot>  </p2>  residues predicted to reside in the contact region and to interact with each other .
We studied the capacity of these mutants to form an <p1  pair=11 >  <prot>  IL - 6 </prot>  </p1>  / <p2  pair=11 >  <prot>  IL - 6R </prot>  </p2>  complex and their ability to transduce the signal .
This combined approach has led to the identification of certain residue - clusters in the binding interface and to a rational explanation of their specific interactions , suggesting therein a likely mechanism of complex formation .
The results confirm the predictive model and strongly support our hypothesis .
Comparison with other cytokines and their alpha - subunit receptors suggests that the structural location of certain binding sites are conserved .

We employed both random and site - specific mutagenesis to determine the function of amino acid residues in the extracellular domain ( referred to as <prot>  <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  EPO </prot>  </p1>  binding protein </prot>  , <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  EBP </prot>  </p2>  ) of the <prot>  EPOR </prot>  .
Residues were chosen for site - specific alanine substitution based on the results of the random mutagenesis or on their homology to residues that are conserved or have been reported to be involved in ligand binding in other receptors of the cytokine receptor family .
Site - specific mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli as soluble <prot>  EBP </prot>  and analyzed for <prot>  EPO </prot>  binding in several different assay formats .
In addition , selected mutant proteins were expressed as full - length <prot>  EPOR </prot>  on the surface of COS cells and analyzed for 125I - <prot>  EPO </prot>  binding in receptor binding assays .

In order to characterize the signaling pathway through which <prot>  FGFR3 </prot>  regulates cell growth , L6 cells lacking any endogenous FGFR were stably transfected with the two different human isoforms , <prot>  <prot>  FGFR3 </prot>  IIIb </prot>  and <prot>  <prot>  FGFR3 </prot>  IIIc </prot>  , that result from alternative splicing of exon III of the <prot>  FGFR3 </prot>  gene encoding the ligand binding domain .
Expression of <prot>  <prot>  FGFR3 </prot>  IIIc </prot>  in stably transfected L6 cells conferred growth responses to several members of the FGF family including <prot>  FGF - 1 </prot>  , - 2 , - 4 , and - 6 , while <prot>  <prot>  FGFR3 </prot>  IIIb </prot>  - expressing cells responded only to <prot>  FGF - 1 </prot>  .
Activation of <prot>  FGFR3 </prot>  upon ligand binding resulted in activation of <prot>  mitogen - activated protein kinase </prot>  pathway .
 <prot> FGFR3 </prot>  utilizes two different pools of adapter protein <prot>  GRB2 </prot>  to link to <prot>  Ras </prot>  .

TI - Identification of interaction partners for the basic - helix - loop - helix protein <prot>  E47 </prot>  .
PG - 891 - 8 AB - Helix - loop - helix proteins constitute a family of transcription factors with the potential to form homo - and hetero - dimers mediated by the helix - loop - helix domain .
Oncogenic mutations in such genes can disrupt the equilibrium of protein - protein interactions in the affected cell .
In order to assess the biological consequences of such mutations , the full complement of interacting proteins must be known .
To identify proteins interacting with the basic - helix - loop - helix domain of the ubiquitously expressed <prot>  E47 </prot>  protein , a ' sandwich ' - screening procedure was developed which distinguishes between homo - and hetero - oligomers , and specifically excludes the detection of complexes which cannot bind DNA .
Nine distinct cDNAs were identified which encode proteins with apparent basic - helix - loop - helix domains , including a novel clone termed <prot>  eip1 </prot>  which is distantly related in the basic - helix - loop - helix domain to the Drosophila enhancer - of - split m7 protein .
Using epitope - tagging , interaction of <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  E47 </prot>  </p1>  basic - helix - loop - helix protein with the <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  eip1 </prot>  </p2>  protein encoded by this novel cDNA was confirmed by immunoprecipitation experiments in COS7 cells .

However , the mechanism is still obscure .
Our finding that <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  HBx </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  directly interacts with <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  RNA polymerase II subunit 5 </prot>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  RPB5 </prot>  </p2>  ) , a common subunit of RNA polymerases , implies that <prot>  HBx </prot>  directly modulates the function of RNA polymerase ( Cheong , J. H. , Yi , M. , Lin , Y. , and Murakami , S. ( 1995 ) EMBO J. 14 , 142 - 150 ) .
In this context , we examined the possibility that <prot>  HBx </prot>  and <prot>  RPB5 </prot>  interact with other general transcription factors .
 <prot> HBx </prot>  and <prot>  RPB5 </prot>  specifically bound to <prot>  transcription factor IIB </prot>  ( <prot>  TFIIB </prot>  ) in vitro , both of which were detected by either far - Western blotting or the glutathione S - transferase - resin pull - down assay .
Delineation of the binding regions of these three proteins revealed that <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  HBx </prot>  </p1>  , <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  RPB5 </prot>  </p2>  , and <prot>  TFIIB </prot>  each has two binding regions for the other two proteins .
Co - immunoprecipitation using HepG2 cell lysates that express <prot>  HBx </prot>  demonstrated trimeric interaction in vivo .
Some <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  HBx </prot>  </p1>  substitution mutants , which had severely impaired transacting activity , exhibited reduced binding affinity with either <prot>  TFIIB </prot>  or <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  RPB5 </prot>  </p2>  in a mutually exclusive manner , suggesting that <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  HBx </prot>  </p1>  transactivation requires the interactions of both <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  RPB5 </prot>  </p2>  and <prot>  TFIIB </prot>  .
These results indicated that <prot>  HBx </prot>  is a novel virus modulator that facilitates transcriptional initiation by stabilizing the association between RNA polymerase and <prot>  TFIIB </prot>  through communication with <prot>  RPB5 </prot>  and <prot>  TFIIB </prot>  .

PG - 190 - 4 AB - <prot>  Interleukin - 1 </prot>  ( <prot>  IL - 1 </prot>  ) is an important mediator of inflammatory disease .
The <prot>  IL - 1 </prot>  family currently consists of two agonists , <prot>  IL - 1alpha </prot>  and <prot>  IL - 1beta </prot>  , and one antagonist , <prot>  IL - 1ra </prot>  .

PG - 81 - 8 AB - Here , we describe the production of <prot>  recombinant human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases - 1 </prot>  ( <prot>  rTIMP - 1 </prot>  ) and wild - type and mutant human <prot>  collagenase type I </prot>  ( <prot>  rMMP - 1 </prot>  ) proteins in SF9 cells by the baculovirus expression system .
Wild - type <prot>  MMP - 1 </prot>  , as well as the <prot>  MMP - 1 </prot>  mutant lacking the C - terminal hemopexin - like domain [ des - ( 248 - 450 ) - <prot>  MMP - 1 </prot>  ] , exhibit enzymatic activity upon cleavage of the prodomain by treatment with <prot>  trypsin </prot>  or 4 - aminophenylmercuric acetate .
Enzyme activity of both proteins can be inhibited by addition of <prot>  rTIMP </prot>  .
Deletion of the complete active - site [ des - ( 161 - 228 ) - <prot>  MMP - 1 </prot>  ] within the catalytic domain , or mutation of a single His residue of the Zn2+ binding domain ( His199 ) , generates stable forms of <prot>  MMP - 1 </prot>  proteins which are unable to digest <prot>  collagen type I </prot>  or <prot>  beta - casein </prot>  .
In addition to co - immunoprecipitation analysis , we have established a rapid and sensitive ELISA assay using immobilized <prot>  rTIMP </prot>  to determine the structural requirements of <prot>  MMP - 1 </prot>  to form complexes with its inhibitor .
Only the activated and not the latent forms of wild - type and C - terminal mutant des - ( 248 - 450 ) - <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  MMP - 1 </prot>  </p1>  proteins are able to form complexes with <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  TIMP </prot>  </p2>  .
Neither mutation of His199 , nor deletion mutants des - ( 161 - 228 ) - <prot>  MMP - 1 </prot>  and des - ( 161 - 228 / 248 - 450 ) - <prot>  MMP - 1 </prot>  , interact with <prot>  TIMP </prot>  .
This demonstrates that the C - terminal hemopexin domain of <prot>  MMP - 1 </prot>  , in contrast to the corresponding regions of <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  gelatinase A </prot>  </p1>  and <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  gelatinase B </prot>  </p1>  , does not interact with <p2  pair=4 >  <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  TIMP - 1 </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  .
In summary , we have shown that the integrity of the catalytic domain of <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  MMP - 1 </prot>  </p1>  and its ability to bind Zn2+ is absolutely required for complex formation with <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  TIMP - 1 </prot>  </p2>  , which further underlines the importance of this region for proper regulation of enzymatic activity of <prot>  MMP - 1 </prot>  .

Binding of the C - SH2 domain to the Y463 phosphopeptide , together with preferential binding of the N - SH2 domain to the Y429 - Y441 phosphopeptide , suggests a bivalent interaction .
A <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  120 - kDa phosphoprotein </prot>  </p1>  ( <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  pp120 </prot>  </p1>  ) associated with <p2  pair=5 >  <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  CD5 </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  and specifically with the Y429 - Y441 phosphopeptide in stimulated thymocytes .

TI - Functional significance of <prot>  CD9 </prot>  association with beta 1 integrins in human epidermal keratinocytes .
PG - 297 - 305 AB - <prot>  CD9 </prot>  is a member of the tetraspan ( TM4 ) family of proteins and is abundantly expressed in the epidermis .
As <prot>  CD9 </prot>  forms complexes with beta 1 integrins and the integrins are known to regulate keratinocyte behaviour , we investigated <prot>  CD9 </prot>  expression and function in human epidermal keratinocytes .
 <prot> CD9 </prot>  was present in all the living layers of the epidermis , whereas the beta 1 integrins were largely confined to the basal layer ; the same relative distribution was found in stratified cultures of keratinocytes .
There was extensive co - localisation of <prot>  CD9 </prot>  and beta 1 integrins on microvilli and at cell - cell borders of basal keratinocytes ; however , in contrast to the integrins , <prot>  CD9 </prot>  was not found in focal adhesions .
 <prot> CD9 </prot>  was detected in beta 1 integrin immunoprecipitates and also in immunoprecipitates of <prot>  CD44 </prot>  and <prot>  syndecan </prot>  , but not of cadherins .
 <prot> CD9 </prot>  was associated with alpha 3 beta 1 but not alpha 5 beta 1 ; small amounts of <prot>  CD9 </prot>  also co - immunoprecipitated with antibodies to alpha 2 beta 1 and alpha 6 beta 4 .
Antibodies to <prot>  CD9 </prot>  did not affect the proportion of keratinocytes that adhered to <prot>  laminin 1 </prot>  , <prot>  type IV collagen </prot>  and <prot>  fibronectin </prot>  , but did inhibit motility of keratinocytes on tissue culture plastic .
Like antibodies to the <prot>  beta 1 integrin </prot>  subunit , anti - <prot>  CD9 </prot>  inhibited suspension - induced terminal differentiation .
These results suggest that <prot>  CD9 </prot>  may play a role in regulating keartinocyte motility and differentiation .

PG - 1171 - 84 AB - Withdrawal from the cell cycle of differentiating myocytes is regulated by the <prot>  myogenic basic helix - loop - helix </prot>  ( <prot>  bHLH </prot>  ) protein <prot>  MyoD </prot>  and the pocket proteins <prot>  pRb </prot>  , <prot>  p107 </prot>  and <prot>  pRb2 </prot>  / <prot>  p130 </prot>  .
Downstream effectors of ' pocket ' proteins are the components of the <prot>  E2F </prot>  family of transcription factors , which regulate the G1 / S - phase transition .
We analysed by EMSA the composition of <prot>  E2F </prot>  complexes in cycling , quiescent undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 skeletal muscle cells .
An <prot>  E2F </prot>  complex containing mainly <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  E2F4 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  pRb2 </prot>  </p2>  / <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  p130 </prot>  </p2>  ( <prot>  E2F </prot>  - G0 / G1 complex ) appears when DNA synthesis arrests , replacing the <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  cyclinA </prot>  </p1>  / <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  cdk2 </prot>  </p2>  containing <prot>  E2F </prot>  complex of proliferating myoblasts ( <prot>  E2F </prot>  - G1 / S complex ) .
Serum stimulation reinduces DNA synthesis and the re - appearance of <prot>  E2F </prot>  - G1 / S complexes in quiescent myoblasts but not in differentiated C2C12 myotubes .
In differentiating C2C12 cells , <prot>  E2F </prot>  complexes switch and DNA synthesis in response to serum are prevented when <prot>  MyoD </prot>  DNA binding activity and the cdks inhibitor <prot>  MyoD </prot>  downstream effector <prot>  p21 </prot>  are induced .
Thus , during myogenic differentiation , formation of <p1  pair=5 >  <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  E2F4 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  pRb2 </prot>  </p2>  / <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  p130 </prot>  </p2>  containing complexes is an early event , but not enough on its own to prevent the reactivation of DNA synthesis .
Using a subclone of C3H10T1 / 2 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing <prot>  Estrogen Receptor </prot>  - <prot>  MyoD </prot>  ( <prot>  ER </prot>  - <prot>  MyoD </prot>  ) chimerae , we found that estrogen directed <prot>  MyoD </prot>  activation prevents the reassociation of <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  cyclinA </prot>  </p1>  / <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  cdk2 </prot>  </p2>  to the <prot>  E2F4 </prot>  containing complex following serum stimulation and this correlates with suppression of <prot>  E2F </prot>  activity and the inability of cells to re - enter the cell cycle .
Our data indicate that , in differentiating myocytes , one mechanism through which <prot>  MyoD </prot>  induces permanent cell cycle arrest involves <prot>  p21 </prot>  upregulation and suppression of the proliferation - associated cdks - containing <prot>  E2F </prot>  complexes formation .

TI - Early events in TNF signaling : a story of associations and dissociations .
PG - 559 - 66 AB - At the cellular level , the multifunctional cytokine tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) modulates growth and activates genes through various intermediates , including protein kinases , protein phosphatases , reactive oxygen intermediates , phospholipases , proteases , sphingomyelinases , and transcription factors .
Unlike many cytokine receptors , however , the cytoplasmic domain ( CD ) of the TNF receptors lacks an intrinsic protein kinase activity and yet on interaction with ligand it phosphorylates various proteins .
Although the kinetics of most of these activities differ , their interactions are coordinated through the selective interplay between the CD of the receptors and the associated proteins .
A unique pathway has been identified by the ability of the TNF receptors to associate with a novel family of proteins .
Two distinct families of proteins have emerged , the TNF receptor - associated factors ( TRAFs ) and the death domain homologues .
The cloning of members of these gene families and the identification of the protein - interaction motifs found within their gene products has initiated the molecular identity of factors ( <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  TRADD </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  , <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  FADD </prot>  </p1>  / <p1  pair=5 >  <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  MORT </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  , <prot>  RIP </prot>  , <p1  pair=7 >  <p1  pair=8 >  <prot>  FLICE </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  / <p1  pair=10 >  <p1  pair=9 >  <prot>  MACH </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  , and TRAFs ) associated with both of the <p2  pair=1 >  <p2  pair=3 >  <p2  pair=5 >  <p2  pair=7 >  <p2  pair=9 >  <prot>  p60 </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  </p2>  </p2>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=10 >  <p2  pair=2 >  <p2  pair=6 >  <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  p80 </prot>  </p2>  </p2>  </p2>  </p2>  forms of the TNF receptor and with other members of the TNF receptor superfamily .
In this review , we summarize these and other TNF receptor - associated proteins and their potential roles in regulating the activation of <prot>  nuclear factor - kappaB </prot>  and apoptosis , two major responses activated by engagement of TNF receptors by the ligand .

TI - Protein binding and signaling properties of <prot>  RIN1 </prot>  suggest a unique effector function .
PG - 4954 - 9 AB - Human <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  RIN1 </prot>  </p1>  was first characterized as a <prot>  <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  RAS </prot>  </p2>  binding protein </prot>  based on the properties of its carboxyl - terminal domain .
We now show that full - length <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  RIN1 </prot>  </p1>  interacts with activated <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  RAS </prot>  </p2>  in mammalian cells and defines a minimum region of 434 aa required for efficient <prot>  RAS </prot>  binding .
 <p1  pair=3 >  <prot> RIN1 </prot>  </p1>  interacts with the AMPPPP quot ; effector domain AMPPPP quot ; of <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  RAS </prot>  </p2>  and employs some <prot>  RAS </prot>  determinants that are common to , and others that are distinct from , those required for the binding of <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  RAF1 </prot>  </p1>  , a known <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  RAS </prot>  </p2>  effector .
The same domain of <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  RIN1 </prot>  </p1>  that binds <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  RAS </prot>  </p2>  also interacts with 14 - 3 - 3 proteins , extending the similarity between <prot>  RIN1 </prot>  and other <prot>  RAS </prot>  effectors .
When expressed in mammalian cells , the <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  RAS </prot>  </p1>  binding domain of <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  RIN1 </prot>  </p2>  can act as a dominant negative signal transduction blocker .
The amino - terminal domain of <prot>  RIN1 </prot>  contains a proline - rich sequence similar to consensus Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) binding regions .
This <p1  pair=8 >  <prot>  RIN1 </prot>  </p1>  sequence shows preferential binding to the <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  ABL - SH3 </prot>  </p2>  domain in vitro .
Moreover , the amino - terminal domain of <p1  pair=9 >  <prot>  RIN1 </prot>  </p1>  directly associates with , and is tyrosine phosphorylated by , <p2  pair=9 >  <prot>  c - ABL </prot>  </p2>  .
In addition , <prot>  RIN1 </prot>  encodes a functional SH2 domain that has the potential to activate downstream signals .
These data suggest that <prot>  RIN1 </prot>  is able to mediate multiple signals .
A differential pattern of expression and alternate splicing indicate several levels of <prot>  RIN1 </prot>  regulation .

PG - 2091 - 8 AB - Heterodimerization among the basic - leucine zipper ( bZIP ) proteins or among the basic - helix - loop - helix - leucine zipper ( bHLHZip ) proteins confers a multitude of combinational activities to these transcription factors .
To further examine the function of the bHLHZip protein , <prot>  USF </prot>  , we screened for cellular proteins which could directly interact with <prot>  USF </prot>  using the yeast two - hybrid system .
A bZip protein , <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  Fra1 </prot>  </p1>  , was found to efficiently interact with <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  USF </prot>  </p2>  .
 <p1  pair=3 >  <prot> USF </prot>  </p1>  specifically interacts with <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  Fra1 </prot>  </p2>  but not with other closely related family members , <prot>  c - Fos </prot>  , <prot>  Fra2 </prot>  , <prot>  FosB </prot>  , or with <prot>  c - Jun </prot>  .
Both the bHLHZip and the N - terminal regions of <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  Fra1 </prot>  </p1>  are required for efficient interaction with <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  USF </prot>  </p2>  .
In vivo association between <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  USF </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  Fra1 </prot>  </p2>  has been demonstrated by co - immunoprecipitation .
Expression of exogenous <prot>  USF </prot>  led to a decrease in <prot>  AP1 </prot>  - dependent transcription in F9 cells .
Co - expression of exogenous <prot>  Fra1 </prot>  restored the <prot>  AP1 </prot>  activity in a dose - dependent manner .
These data show that <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  USF </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  Fra1 </prot>  </p2>  physically and functionally interact demonstrating that cross - talk occurs between factors of distantly related transcription families .

TI - Ligands for ErbB - family receptors encoded by a neuregulin - like gene .
PG - 509 - 12 AB - Neuregulins ( also called ARIA , GGF , heregulin or NDF ) are a group of polypeptide factors that arise from alternative RNA splicing of a single gene .
Through their interaction with the ErbB family of receptors ( <prot>  ErbB2 </prot>  , <prot>  ErbB3 </prot>  and <prot>  ErbB4 </prot>  ) , neuregulins help to regulate cell growth and differentiation in many tissues .
Here we report the cloning of a second neuregulin - like gene , <prot>  neuregulin - 2 </prot>  .
The encoded product of the <prot>  neuregulin - 2 </prot>  gene has a motif structure similar to that of neuregulins and an alternative splicing site in the <prot>  epidermal growth factor </prot>  ( <prot>  EGF </prot>  ) - like domain gives rise to two isoforms ( alpha and beta ) .
Northern blot and in situ hybridization analysis of adult rat tissues indicate that expression of <prot>  neuregulin - 2 </prot>  is highest in the cerebellum , and the expression pattern is different from that of neuregulins .
Recombinant <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  neuregulin - 2beta </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  induces the tyrosine - phosphorylation of <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  ErbB2 </prot>  </p2>  , <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  ErbB3 </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  ErbB4 </prot>  </p2>  in cell lines expressing all of these ErbB - family receptors .
However , in cell lines with defined combinations of ErbBs , <p1  pair=4 >  <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  neuregulin - 2beta </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  only activates those with <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  ErbB3 </prot>  </p2>  and / or <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  ErbB4 </prot>  </p2>  , suggesting that signalling by <prot>  neuregulin - 2 </prot>  is mediated by <prot>  ErbB3 </prot>  and / or <prot>  ErbB4 </prot>  receptors .

TI - Interaction between <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  ATM </prot>  </p1>  protein and <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  c - Abl </prot>  </p2>  in response to DNA damage .
PG - 520 - 3 AB - The gene mutated in the autosomal recessive disorder ataxia telangiectasia ( AT ) , designated <prot>  ATM </prot>  ( for ' <prot>  AT mutated </prot>  ' ) , is a member of a family of phosphatidylinositol - 3 - kinase - like enzymes that are involved in cell - cycle control , meiotic recombination , telomere length monitoring and DNA - damage response .
Previous results have demonstrated that AT cells are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation and are defective at the G1 / S checkpoint after radiation damage .
Because cells lacking the protein tyrosine kinase <prot>  c - Abl </prot>  are also defective in radiation - induced G1 arrest , we investigated the possibility that <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  ATM </prot>  </p1>  might interact with <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  c - Abl </prot>  </p2>  in response to radiation damage .
Here we show that <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  ATM </prot>  </p1>  binds <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  c - Abl </prot>  </p2>  constitutively in control cells but not in AT cells .
Our results demonstrate that the SH3 domain of <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  c - Abl </prot>  </p1>  interacts with a DPAPNPPHFP motif ( residues 1 , 373 - 1 , 382 ) of <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  ATM </prot>  </p2>  .
The results also reveal that radiation - induction of <prot>  c - Abl </prot>  tyrosine kinase activity is diminished in AT cells .
These findings indicate that <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  ATM </prot>  </p1>  is involved in the activation of <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  c - Abl </prot>  </p2>  by DNA damage and this interaction may in part mediate radiation - induced G1 arrest .

TI - Multiple mechanisms of transcriptional repression by <prot>  YY1 </prot>  .
PG - 3723 - 32 AB - The four C - terminal GLI - Kruppel type zinc fingers of <prot>  YY1 </prot>  have been identified as a transcriptional repression domain .
Previous reports have proposed DNA - bending and activator - quenching mechanisms for this zinc finger - mediated repression .
In addition , previous work indicated that <prot>  p300 </prot>  and <prot>  CBP </prot>  might be involved in <prot>  YY1 </prot>  - mediated repression .
We have analyzed these possible models for the zinc finger - mediated repression .
The role of each zinc finger in the repression and DNA - binding functions was determined by using a structure - and - function approach .
We show that zinc finger 2 of <prot>  YY1 </prot>  plays a central role in both DNA binding and transcriptional repression .
However , a survey of a panel of <prot>  YY1 </prot>  mutants indicates that these two functions can be separated , which argues against the DNA - bending model for repression .
We show that the physical interaction between <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  YY1 </prot>  </p1>  and <p1  pair=2 >  <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  p300 </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  , a coactivator for <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  CREB </prot>  </p2>  , is not sufficient for repression of <prot>  CREB </prot>  - mediated transcription .
Our studies indicate that <prot>  YY1 </prot>  functions as an activator - specific repressor .
Repression of <prot>  CTF - 1 </prot>  - directed transcription may be accomplished through direct physical interaction between <prot>  YY1 </prot>  and this activator .
In contrast , physical interaction is not necessary for <prot>  YY1 </prot>  to repress <prot>  Sp1 </prot>  - and <prot>  CREB </prot>  - mediated transcription .
Rather , the repression likely reflects an ability of <prot>  YY1 </prot>  to interfere with communication between these activators and their targets within the general transcription machinery .
Taken together , our results suggest that <prot>  YY1 </prot>  employs multiple mechanisms to achieve activator - specific repression .

PG - 70 - 6 AB - The molecular adapter <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  c - Cbl </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated following stimulation through the <prot>  TCR </prot>  and associates with <prot>  Src </prot>  homology domain - 2 ( SH2 ) / SH3 domain - containing adapters such as <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  Grb2 </prot>  </p2>  , <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  Crk </prot>  </p2>  , and <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  Crk - L </prot>  </p2>  , which interact with guanine nucleotide exchange factors specific for the Ras family .
This suggests that <prot>  c - Cbl </prot>  may link <prot>  TCR </prot>  activation to molecules that regulate GTP binding proteins .
The SH2 / SH3 - containing protein <prot>  Vav </prot>  also contains a guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain , and <prot>  Vav </prot>  has a crucial role in thymocyte development and activation of peripheral T cells following stimulation through the <prot>  TCR </prot>  .
Here we show that <p1  pair=5 >  <prot>  Vav </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  c - Cbl </prot>  </p2>  form inducible molecular complexes in <prot>  TCR </prot>  - activated murine thymocytes and peripheral T cells as well as pervanadate - treated T cells .
 <p1  pair=6 >  <prot> Vav </prot>  </p1>  / <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  c - Cbl </prot>  </p2>  interactions are also detectable in freshly isolated T cells from gene - targeted mice that lack the T cell - specific inhibitory receptor <prot>  CTLA - 4 </prot>  , in which <prot>  c - Cbl </prot>  is hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine residues .
The interaction between <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  Vav </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  c - Cbl </prot>  </p2>  is directly mediated via the SH2 domain of <prot>  Vav </prot>  and is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of <prot>  c - Cbl </prot>  .
In addition , we show that the conserved motif Y699 MTP present in <p1  pair=8 >  <prot>  c - Cbl </prot>  </p1>  is the binding site for the <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  Vav </prot>  </p2>  SH2 domain in vitro .
These data imply that <prot>  c - Cbl </prot>  is a molecular adapter that regulates the function of <prot>  Vav </prot>  in thymocytes and peripheral T cells .

The structure shows the partly hydrophilic and partly hydrophobic nature of the communication between the two molecules , which explains the sensitivity of the interaction toward both salts and lipids .
An arginine side chain ( arginine - 789 ) of <prot>  GAP - 334 </prot>  is supplied into the active site of <prot>  Ras </prot>  to neutralize developing charges in the transition state .
The switch II region of <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  Ras </prot>  </p1>  is stabilized by <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  GAP - 334 </prot>  </p2>  , thus allowing glutamine - 61 of <prot>  Ras </prot>  , mutation of which activates the oncogenic potential , to participate in catalysis .

Glycine - 12 in the transition state mimic is within van der Waals distance of both arginine - 789 of <prot>  GAP - 334 </prot>  and glutamine - 61 of <prot>  Ras </prot>  , and even its mutation to alanine would disturb the arrangements of residues in the transition state .

When human soluble <prot>  FasL </prot>  ( sFasL , containing the extracellular portion ) was expressed in human embryo kidney 293 cells , the three N - linked glycans of each <prot>  FasL </prot>  monomer were found to be essential for efficient secretion .
Based on the structure of the closely related <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  lymphotoxin alpha </prot>  </p1>  - <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  tumor necrosis factor receptor I </prot>  </p2>  complex , a molecular model of the <p1  pair=8 >  <p1  pair=9 >  <p2  pair=8 >  <prot>  FasL </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  </p1>  homotrimer bound to three <p2  pair=9 >  <prot>  Fas </prot>  </p2>  molecules was generated using knowledge - based protein modeling methods .
Point mutations of amino acid residues predicted to affect the receptor - ligand interaction were introduced at three sites .
The F275L mutant , mimicking the loss of function murine gld mutation , exhibited a high propensity for aggregation and was unable to bind to <prot>  Fas </prot>  .
Mutants P206R , P206D , and P206F displayed reduced cytotoxicity toward <prot>  Fas </prot>  - positive cells with a concomitant decrease in the binding affinity for the recombinant <prot>  Fas </prot>  - immunoglobulin Fc fusion proteins .
Although the cytotoxic activity of mutant Y218D was unaltered , mutant Y218R was inactive , correlating with the prediction that Tyr - 218 of <p1  pair=10 >  <prot>  FasL </prot>  </p1>  interacts with a cluster of three basic amino acid side chains of <p2  pair=10 >  <prot>  Fas </prot>  </p2>  .
Interestingly , mutant Y218F could induce apoptosis in murine , but not human cells .

TI - Mutational analysis of <prot>  thrombopoietin </prot>  for identification of receptor and neutralizing antibody sites .
PG - 20595 - 602 AB - <prot>  Thrombopoietin </prot>  ( <prot>  TPO </prot>  ) is a hematopoietin important for megakaryocyte proliferation and production of blood platelets .
We sought to characterize how <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  TPO </prot>  </p1>  binds and activates its receptor , <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  myeloproliferative leukemia virus receptor </prot>  </p2>  .
The <prot>  erythropoietin </prot>  - like domain of <prot>  TPO </prot>  ( TPO1 - 153 ) has been fused to the <prot>  gIII </prot>  coat protein of M13 bacteriophage .
Forty residues were chosen for mutation to alanine using the criteria that they were charged residues or predicted to be solvent - exposed , based on a homology model .
Phage enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine affinities for binding to both the <prot>  TPO </prot>  receptor and five anti - <prot>  TPO1 </prot>  - 153 monoclonal antibodies .
Mutations at mostly positively charged residues ( Asp8 , Lys14 , Lys52 , Lys59 , Lys136 , Lys138 , Arg140 ) caused the greatest reduction in receptor - binding affinity .
Most of these residues mapped to helices - 1 and - 4 and a loop region between helix - 1 and helix - 2 .
Two of the monoclonal antibodies that blocked <prot>  TPO </prot>  binding and bioactivity had determinants in helix - 4 .
In contrast , the other three monoclonal antibodies , which were effective at blocking <prot>  TPO </prot>  activity but did not block initial binding of <prot>  TPO </prot>  to its receptor , had epitopes predominantly on helix or 3 .
These results suggest that <prot>  TPO </prot>  has two distinct receptor - binding sites that function to dimerize <prot>  TPO </prot>  receptors in a sequential fashion .

TI - <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  14 - 3 - 3 zeta </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  negatively regulates <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  raf - 1 </prot>  </p2>  activity by interactions with the <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  </p2>  cysteine - rich domain .
PG - 20990 - 3 AB - Although <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  is a critical effector of <prot>  Ras </prot>  signaling and transformation , the mechanism by which <prot>  Ras </prot>  promotes <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  activation is complex and remains poorly understood .
We recently reported that <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  Ras </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  interaction with the <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  cysteine - rich domain </prot>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  Raf - CRD </prot>  </p2>  , residues 139 - 184 ) may be required for <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  activation .
The <prot>  Raf - CRD </prot>  is located in the NH2 - terminal negative regulatory domain of <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  and is highly homologous to cysteine - rich domains found in protein kinase C family members .
Recent studies indicate that the structural integrity of the <prot>  Raf - CRD </prot>  is also critical for <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  interaction with 14 - 3 - 3 proteins .
However , whether 14 - 3 - 3 proteins interact directly with the <prot>  Raf - CRD </prot>  and how this interaction may mediate <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  function has not been determined .
In the present study , we demonstrate that <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  14 - 3 - 3 zeta </prot>  </p1>  binds directly to the isolated <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  Raf - CRD </prot>  </p2>  .
Moreover , mutation of <p1  pair=5 >  <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  residues 143 - 145 impairs binding of 14 - 3 - 3 , but not <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  Ras </prot>  </p2>  , to the <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  Raf - CRD </prot>  </p2>  .
Introduction of mutations that impair 14 - 3 - 3 binding resulted in full - length <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  mutants with enhanced transforming activity .
Thus , 14 - 3 - 3 interaction with the <prot>  Raf - CRD </prot>  may serve in negative regulation of <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  function by facilitating dissociation of 14 - 3 - 3 from the NH2 terminus of <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  to promote subsequent events necessary for full activation of <prot>  Raf - 1 </prot>  .

TI - Interactions between <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  brain - derived neurotrophic factor </prot>  </p1>  and the <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  <prot>  TRKB </prot>  receptor </prot>  </p2>  .
Identification of two ligand binding domains in soluble <prot>  TRKB </prot>  by affinity separation and chemical cross - linking .
PG - 25296 - 303 AB - The extracellular domain of the human <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  neurotrophin <prot>  TRKB </prot>  receptor </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells is a highly glycosylated protein , possessing binding ability for <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  brain - derived neurotrophic factor </prot>  </p2>  ( <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  BDNF </prot>  </p2>  ) .
Two distinct ligand binding domains of <prot>  TRKB </prot>  were isolated from proteolytic digests of the receptor by affinity separation on immobilized <prot>  BDNF </prot>  .
One of these domains consists of amino acid residues 103 - 181 and contains both the third leucine - rich motif and the second cysteine cluster domain .
The second domain is close to the second immunoglobulin - like domain ( amino acid residues 342 - 394 ) .
Each of these two domains can bind <prot>  BDNF </prot>  independently .
Disulfide linkages present in the first domain are necessary for <prot>  BDNF </prot>  binding , probably because of preservation of the native conformation .
To study the second domain in greater detail , a truncated form of <prot>  TRKB </prot>  containing the second immunoglobulin - like domain ( residues 248 - 398 ) was expressed in Escherichia coli .
This domain was cross - linked to <prot>  BDNF </prot>  through a 1 - ethyl - 3 - ( 3 - dimethylaminopropyl ) carbodiimide coupling reaction .
Several synthetic peptides corresponding to amino acid residues 343 - 379 were able to bind immobilized <prot>  BDNF </prot>  .
Amino acid substitution and cross - linking analysis indicated that amino acids Phe347 , Asp354 , and Tyr361 are intimately involved in <prot>  BDNF </prot>  binding .
These results , obtained from a variety of experimental techniques , highlight the importance of two distinct regions of the extracellular domain of the <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  <prot>  TRKB </prot>  receptor </prot>  </p1>  in binding <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  BDNF </prot>  </p2>  .

PG - 26388 - 93 AB - Coexpression of the alpha and betaL subunits of the human <prot>  <prot>  interferon alpha </prot>  ( <prot>  IFNalpha </prot>  ) receptor </prot>  is required for the induction of an antiviral state by human <prot>  IFNalpha </prot>  .
To explore the role of the different domains of the betaL subunit in <prot>  IFNalpha </prot>  signaling , we coexpressed wild - type alpha subunit and truncated forms of the betaL chain in L - 929 cells .
Our results demonstrated that the first 82 amino acids ( AAs ) ( AAs 265 - 346 ) of the cytoplasmic domain of the betaL chain are sufficient to activate the <prot>  Jak </prot>  - Stat pathway and trigger an antiviral state after <prot>  IFNalpha2 </prot>  binding to the receptor .
This region of the betaL chain , required for <prot>  Jak1 </prot>  binding and activation , contains the Box 1 motif that is important for the interaction of some cytokine receptors with <prot>  Jak </prot>  kinases .
However , using glutathione S - transferase fusion proteins containing amino - and carboxyl - terminal deletions of the betaL cytoplasmic domain , we demonstrate that the main <prot>  Jak1 </prot>  - binding region ( corresponding to AAs 300 - 346 on the beta subunit ) is distinct from the Box 1 domain ( AAs 287 - 295 ) .

TI - A <prot>  c - Cbl </prot>  yeast two hybrid screen reveals interactions with 14 - 3 - 3 isoforms and cytoskeletal components .
PG - 46 - 50 AB - The protein product of <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  c - cbl </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  proto - oncogene is known to interact with several proteins , including <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  Grb2 </prot>  </p2>  , <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  Crk </prot>  </p2>  and <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  PI3 kinase </prot>  </p2>  , and is thought to regulate signalling by many cell surface receptors .
The precise function of <prot>  c - Cbl </prot>  in these pathways is not clear , although a genetic analysis in Caenorhabditis elegans suggests that <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  c - Cbl </prot>  </p1>  is a negative regulator of the <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  <prot>  epidermal growth factor </prot>  receptor </prot>  </p2>  .
Here we describe a yeast two hybrid screen performed with <prot>  c - Cbl </prot>  in an attempt to further elucidate its role in signal transduction .
The screen identified interactions involving <p1  pair=5 >  <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  c - Cbl </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  and two 14 - 3 - 3 isoforms , <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  cytokeratin 18 </prot>  </p2>  , human unconventional myosin IC , and a recently identified SH3 domain containing protein , <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  SH3 P17 </prot>  </p2>  .
We have used the yeast two hybrid assay to localise regions of <prot>  c - Cbl </prot>  required for its interaction with each of the proteins .
Interaction with 14 - 3 - 3 is demonstrated in mammalian cell extracts .

TI - Interaction between cell cycle regulator , <p1  pair=1 >  <prot>  E2F - 1 </prot>  </p1>  , and <p2  pair=1 >  <prot>  NF - kappaB </prot>  </p2>  mediates repression of HIV - 1 gene transcription .
PG - 29468 - 74 AB - The <prot>  NF - kappaB </prot>  / <prot>  Rel </prot>  family of transcription factors is one of the main targets of cytokines and other agents that induce HIV - 1 gene expression .
Some of these extracellular stimuli arrest cells in the G1 phase of the mitotic division cycle and modulate the activity of the tumor suppressor protein <p1  pair=2 >  <prot>  Rb </prot>  </p1>  and its partner <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  E2F - 1 </prot>  </p2>  .
Earlier studies indicated that <prot>  E2F - 1 </prot>  , a transcription factor that stimulates expression of S - phase - specific genes , is able to repress transcription directed by the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV - 1 ) type - 1 promoter in a variety of cells , including those of glial and lymphocytic origin .
Here , we demonstrate that <p1  pair=3 >  <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  E2F - 1 </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  may regulate the activity of the HIV - 1 long terminal repeat through its ability to bind sequences in the <prot>  NF - kappaB </prot>  enhancer region and to interact with the <p2  pair=3 >  <prot>  NF - kappaB </prot>  </p2>  subunit , <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  p50 </prot>  </p2>  .
Gel retardation and methylation interference assays show that <prot>  E2F - 1 </prot>  is able to bind specifically to a site embedded within the two <prot>  NF - kappaB </prot>  elements .
Gel retardation / immunoblot analysis using purified <prot>  E2F - 1 </prot>  and <p1  pair=5 >  <p2  pair=5 >  <prot>  p50 </prot>  </p2>  </p1>  homodimers reveals the presence of complexes containing both proteins .
Affinity chromatography and co - immunoprecipitation assays provide evidence for direct interaction of <p1  pair=6 >  <prot>  E2F - 1 </prot>  </p1>  and <p2  pair=6 >  <prot>  p50 </prot>  </p2>  in the absence of their DNA target sequences .
In vitro transcription assay demonstrates that <prot>  E2F - 1 </prot>  represses <prot>  NF - kappaB </prot>  mediated transcription in a cell - free system .
Functional studies in Jurkat T lymphocytic cells point to the importance of both the <prot>  E2F </prot>  and <prot>  NF - kappaB </prot>  binding sites in <prot>  E2F - 1 </prot>  mediated repression of HIV - 1 promoter , in vivo .
The results of this study suggest that <p1  pair=7 >  <prot>  NF - kappaB </prot>  </p1>  activity may be regulated by its interaction with the cell cycle regulatory protein , <p2  pair=7 >  <prot>  E2F - 1 </prot>  </p2>  .

TI - <prot>  TAP </prot>  - and <prot>  tapasin </prot>  - dependent <prot>  HLA - E </prot>  surface expression correlates with the binding of an MHC class I leader peptide .
PG - 1 - 10 AB - BACKGROUND : The human major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class lb molecule <prot>  HLA - E </prot>  is transcribed in most tissues but little is known about its localisation within the cell .
We have recently shown that <prot>  HLA - E </prot>  binds signal - sequence - derived peptides from human MHC class I molecules in vitro .
RESULTS : Using a newly characterised antibody recognising HLA - E , we show that <prot>  HLA - E </prot>  is expressed at the cell surface .
We demonstrate that <prot>  HLA - E </prot>  surface expression is correlated with the presence of MHC class I molecules which provide suitable leader sequence peptides capable of binding to <prot>  HLA - E </prot>  .
Further studies on the interaction of <prot>  HLA - E </prot>  with molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum revealed that <p1  pair=1 >  <p1  pair=2 >  <p1  pair=3 >  <prot>  HLA - E </prot>  </p1>  </p1>  </p1>  associates with the <p2  pair=1 >  transporter associated with antigen processing </p2>  ( <p2  pair=2 >  <prot>  TAP </prot>  </p2>  ) and <p2  pair=3 >  calreticulin </p2>  , and that <prot>  HLA - E </prot>  expression is <prot>  TAP </prot>  - dependent and tapasin - dependent .
In addition , <p1  pair=4 >  <prot>  HLA - E </prot>  </p1>  dissociates from <p2  pair=4 >  <prot>  TAP </prot>  </p2>  upon binding of MHC class I leader sequence peptides .
CONCLUSION : These experiments establish that surface expression of <prot>  HLA - E </prot>  is regulated by the binding of a restricted pool of peptides from the leader sequence of MHC class I molecules .
The correlation between <prot>  HLA - E </prot>  and MHC class I surface expression might be relevant to the function of <prot>  HLA - E </prot>  .
Our results also show that , although these <prot>  HLA - E </prot>  binding peptides are derived from signal sequences , they may be released back into the cytosol and subsequently translocated by the <prot>  TAP </prot>  complex and loaded onto <prot>  HLA - E </prot>  molecules .
